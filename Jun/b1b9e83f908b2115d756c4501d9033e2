The Senate has ruled out the possibility of a new constitution despite a mass call for it from various stakeholders who said "the 1999 constitution has outlived its usefulness". Adding to the "new" call, the founder of Afe Babalola University Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD), Afe Babalola, described the 1999 constitution as part of the problems of the country, advising President Muhammadu Buhari "to consider the drafting of a new constitution that will capture the demands of many Nigerians". The legal luminary also said that the various regions need to effectively address the challenges of insecurity, unemployment, and poverty in their respective zones.
