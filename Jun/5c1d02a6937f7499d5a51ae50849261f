France has suspended its joint military operations with forces in Mali, after the second coup d'etat in its former colony in nine months. The French Defence Ministry said the decision, taken after consultation with Mali authorities and military, would be reassessed in the coming days. It is currently unclear whether the move means French troops will remain in the West African nation until a fresh decision is taken. France currently has 5,100 troops in the Sahel region as part of an anti-terror operation against militants. The French military has been supporting forces in Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad since 2013. Mali has also been suspended from the African Union and ECOWAS.
