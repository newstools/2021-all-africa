Miners in Botswana have uncovered what could be the third largest diamond of its kind in the world. The 1,098-carat diamond was unearthed on June 1, 2021 by Debswana, a joint venture between the Botswana government and precious stone multinational De Beers. This follows the discovery of a 998-carat diamond in northeastern Botswana's Karowe mine in November 2020 by Lucara Diamond. Botswana is the leading diamond producer in Africa, with seven well-established mines including Jwaneng, the world's richest in terms of value, Orapa, the world's largest by area, along with Karowe and Letlhakane.
