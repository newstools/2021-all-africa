South Africa is facing an uphill battle to keep the lights on, with energy supplier Eskom's past mismanagement, misspent funds and ageing infrastructure the reasons for the country's growing electricity woes. Despite this, South Africans are in disbelief at the sea-based "emergency" solution offered by Turkey's Kapowership and its subsidiary Kapowership South Africa, which was announced on March 18, 2021 as one of the preferred bids under South Africa's Risk Mitigation Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. Emergency, after all, implies a stop-gap measure for a transition to a preferred long-term form of power generation.The plan was launched in 2019 to procure almost 2,000 megawatts of new-generation capacity. However, vigilant South Africans on World Oceans Day, believe that it is their responsibility to protect and restore marine life, writes Tim Walker for The Institute for Security Studies. Concerns are being raised about the ecological impact of the heated water discharged into the harbours or the ineffective limiting of greenhouse gas emissions.
