Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo on June 16, 2021, launched a 223km road project, linking the two countries - a venture that is envisioned to provide a boost to cross border trade and improve security and connectivity between the two countries. Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni and his DR Congo counterpart Felix Tshisekedi said the infrastructure will transform the socio economic welfare of citizens in both countries. The road network is also expected to present a solution to the insecurity that has plagued eastern DR Congo. A number of militant groups, including the Allied Democratic Forces, have used the thick DR Congo forests as a base to destabilise the region. The two leaders reaffirmed their willingness to combine their effort to neutralise negative armed groups destabilising the region."           The project will be funded by the two governments, with each contributing 20% of the cost, while the contractor, Dott Services, a Ugandan Company will raise 60%. The Ugandan government already approved over U.S.$62 million for the project, and Bageya Waiswa, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Works and Transport said they have already received U.S.$28 million.
