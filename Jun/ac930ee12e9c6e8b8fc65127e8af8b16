The government has reportedly extended the dawn to dusk curfew by another two months in a move it insists will help slow the spread of Covid-19. From May 28, 2021 the curfew runs from 10pm to 4am, while transport for both public and private vehicles is banned. Eateries and entertainment spots are also barred from operating. The new order will cover the whole country and will affect all people except essential service providers. Those who wish to be exempted will have to obtain permission by writing to county police commanders or sub-county police commanders. The curfew extension comes as the country's health ministry warned that there was a high possibility of a fourth wave of the virus, as the Covid-19 numbers continue to surge. As of June 1, 2021, Kenya recorded 170,735 Covid-19 cases, 116,847 recoveries and 3,172 deaths.
