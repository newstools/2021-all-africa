Former president Jacob Zuma has been found guilty of contempt of court by the Constitutional Court. Acting Deputy Chief Justice Sisi Khampepe in delivering the verdict, emphasised the extraordinary attacks by Zuma on the legitimacy of the Constitutional Court. "Never before has this Court's authority and legitimacy been subjected to [these] kinds of attacks," she said.  Khampepe also said that Zuma wilfully defied the Court's order to appear before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture despite being aware of the consequences. Khampepe added: "Unfortunately, but not entirely unexpectedly, Mr Zuma... squandered an opportunity to follow and respect this country's legal processes." Khampepe described as "scandalous" the 21-page letter the former president sent to Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng.
