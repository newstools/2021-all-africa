The Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Fatou Bensouda, has stressed the necessity of handing over Ahmed Haroun to the ICC before the end of July 2021, so that he can be tried along with Ali Kushayb for war crimes. At a press conference at Sudan's Ministry of Justice in Khartoum, Bensouda, who is on a three-day visit to Sudan and Darfur, revealed that a team of investigators from the ICC will arrive in the country to collect more evidence. Bensouda, who is on her second visit to Sudan, visited victims in north, south, and west Darfur, where she said she learned of their eagerness to see justice done. She said that accused former Janjaweed leader Ali Kushayb, who is currently in custody and facing trial in The Hague, is "considered the first person to appear before the court for crimes committed in Darfur but that he will not be the last". This will be Bensouda's final visit to Sudan in her capacity as ICC Prosecutor, as her nine-year term expires on June 16, 2021. She will be replaced by British lawyer Karim Ahmed Khan, who was elected as the new Chief Prosecutor in February 2021.
