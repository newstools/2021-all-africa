Germany and the United Nations will host Libyan peace talks on June 23 in Berlin, Germany's foreign ministry said in a statement. It will be the first time that Libya's transitional government will take part in the talks that were launched with the first conference in January 2020. Talks will focus on preparations for national elections planned for December 24. In addition, they will discuss the withdrawal of foreign troops and mercenaries from Libya. According to the UN, more than 20,000 foreign mercenaries and military personnel are still in Libya. They include fighters from Turkey, Russia, Sudan, and Chad. Libya was thrown into a decade of violence following the 2011 overthrow and eventual killing of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Warring factions essentially split the country with the UN-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, controlling the capital Tripoli and Khalifa Haftar, the commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) controlling the east.
