Zambia's electoral body has banned mass political rallies due to a surge in Covid-19 cases ahead of the August 12, 2021 elections. The southern African country, facing a third wave, has over 97,388 confirmed cases, including 92,320 recoveries and 1,288 deaths. To date, more than 147,000 people have received their first dose but only 5,286 people have been fully vaccinated. In 2020 the Zambian government's handling of the crisis was met with fierce criticism from citizens after President Edgar Lungu decided to reopen churches and salons while allowing golfing activities "with a condition that they adhere to prevention measures like social distancing and wearing of masks".
