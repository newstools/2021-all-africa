The country's electoral commission has raised its concerns over attacks on its facilities, destroying ballot boxes and other voting material, with experts saying that it could be a deliberate ploy to disrupt the polls. The commission has recorded at least 42 attacks on its facilities since the last polls in 2019. Nine attacks occurred in 2019 and 21 others took place in 2020. But in the last four weeks, 12 more offices of the commission have either been set alight or vandalised. Election officials are evaluating the extent of the damage but say an initial assessment shows it could significantly affect their ability to conduct credible elections in the affected areas. The electoral body chief Mahmood Yakubu has declared attacks on election offices a national emergency and met with top security chiefs to address the problem.
