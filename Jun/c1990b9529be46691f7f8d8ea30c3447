Three Italian firms at the centre of the multi-million dollar Kimwarer and Arror dams scandal have claimed that power struggles between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto, led to the illegal cancellation of the projects. Cooperativa Muratori & Cementisti - CMC Di Ravenna Societa Cooperativa, Itinera S.P.A and CMC Di Ravanna- Itinera JV S.C.P.A allege that the tender for the construction of the two dams was cancelled to derail Deputy President Ruto's quest for the presidency in the 2022 general elections. The firms quoted press reports, saying Ruto has been a vocal supporter of the projects because it would benefit people in his constituency. They maintain that they were not involved in any irregularity and all that they did was tender for the two contracts in compliance with the tender instructions issued by the Kerio Valley Development Authority, writes Sam Kiplagat for The Nation.
