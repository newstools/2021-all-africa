The multiple award-winning musician Damini Ebunoluwa, popularly known as Burna Boy, has defended his BET award in the Best International act slot. This is his third win in the category for the "African Giant" singer who took home the award in 2019 and 2020. Burna Boy dashed the hopes of fellow countryman Wizkid and Tanzania's Diamond Platnumz. He was also up against Aya Nakamura (France), Emicida (Brazil), Headie One (UK) Young T and Bugsey (UK), and Youssoupha (France). Diamond Platnumz was unlucky for the third time, in his third nomination after giving it a shot in 2014 and 2016 in the category, while Wizkid won it in 2012. The award follows Burna Boy's 2021 Grammy Award glory. He becomes the African artist with the most BET wins thus far.
