Kenya Power has reportedly launched a self-service portal that will enable customers to apply for electricity connections online following a pilot phase that processed 7,000 applications through the platform. The platform is set to remove the middleman and reduce corruption that has characterised the electricity application process for decades. "Online applications will drive up the struggling entity's sales by accelerating connections to new users, and is part of the company's multi-pronged turnaround strategy", Kenya Power Chief Executive, Bernard Ngugi said. The company is also aiming to cut system losses by stemming electricity theft and installing smart meters. It has contracted eight private debt collectors to collect outstanding dues from customers to complement its efforts to boost revenues.
