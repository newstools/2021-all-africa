The government of Burkina Faso has declared three days of mourning following an attack that left at least 160 people dead in the northern village of Solhan. The International Committee for the Red Cross says local hospitals are overwhelmed and has responded to a request for medical supplies in Dori, a town in northern Burkina Faso. The attack happened overnight on Friday June 4, 2021. The village of Solhan, located in Yagha province, near the border with Niger, in the country's Sahel region, is the site of an informal gold mine that terror groups frequently exploit for funding.           No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, although analysts say it could be the work of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara. Voice of America says the attack is the deadliest since the conflict between Burkina Faso and armed groups linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group began in 2015.
