Mali's newly appointed government met on Sunday for the first time with Prime Minister Choguel Kokalla Maïga to discuss their reform plans. In a speech to his cabinet, Choguel Kokalla Maïga indicated that this new government would keep on course with the remaining eight months left to the transition. Mali's government reshuffle comes after the country's third coup d'etat in 10 years, after military actions in 2012 and 2020.  The new transitional government is composed of 28 ministers, including five army officers with opposition members featuring prominently.
