"The government is in talks with Standard Chartered Bank about arranging funding for two rail projects expected to cost as much as U.S.$14.4 billion, replacing earlier plans to source the loans from Chinese banks", Transport Minister Rotimi Amaechi has said. The government has already concluded contracts with the Nigerian unit of state-owned China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) for both deals. By choosing not to borrow from China, the government will cut its debt, which stood at U.S.$3.4 billion as of the end of March 2021. The two rail projects include the eastern line that links Port Harcourt with Maiduguri and the extension of the Lagos-Ibadan rail line to Kano State. President Muhammadu Buhari said the railway project, when completed, would reactivate economic activities along the eastern corridor, which has been greatly affected by insecurity.
