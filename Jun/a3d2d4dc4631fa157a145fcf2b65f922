A lack of adherence to transmission prevention measures has fuelled the new surge that coincides with colder seasonal weather in southern Africa and the spread of more contagious variants. Covid-19 cases in Africa are surging by over 20% week-on-week as the continent's third wave gains pace and nears the first wave peak of more than 120,000 weekly cases recorded in July 2020, new data from the World Health Organization (WHO) shows. "Africa is in the midst of a full blown third wave. The sobering trajectory of surging cases should rouse everyone into urgent action. We've seen in India and elsewhere just how quickly Covid-19 can rebound and overwhelm health systems. So public health measures must be scaled up fast to find, test, isolate and care for patients and to quickly trace their contacts," said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. As of June 18, 2021, confirmed cases of Covid-19 from 55 African countries reached 5,131,085 while over 30,803,242 vaccinations have been administered across the continent.
