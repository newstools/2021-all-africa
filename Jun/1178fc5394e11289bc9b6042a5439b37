The Department of Basic Education has called on all teachers and supstaff to be at school in order to prepare for the Covid-19 vaccination programme. In a statement, the department said the vaccination programme is an opportunity to normalise schooling and intensify the process of mitigating the impact of the outbreak. School governing body associations have supported the vaccination programme and have committed to working closely with the department to ensure all targeted people receive the jab. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said: "For the next two weeks, we make the clarion call to our school communities to 'drop all, and vaccinate!' in order for us to successfully complete this program, we will need to keep schools open." Any disruptions, she said, "would be undesirable". As of June 22, 2021, about 1,832,479 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in the country, of which 58,795 proved fatal and 1,656,680 resulted in recovery.
