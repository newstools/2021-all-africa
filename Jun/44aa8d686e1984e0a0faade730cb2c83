Opposition MDC Alliance has dismissed claims by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), that opposition stronghold Bulawayo province has recorded zero new voters since the beginning of the voter registration exercise. The election management body resumed voter registration on April 1, 2021, after months of suspension of all electoral activities due to Covid-19. The MDC Alliance spokesperson Swithern Chiroodza challenged the election management body to carry out extensive voter registration campaigns as opposed to sitting back and claiming this was the duty of individual parties. On numerous occasions the ZEC has been dubbed biased and their independence questioned by opposition parties as well as independent international media.
