Twitter has deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari in which he threatened to punish pro-Biafra groups blamed for escalating attacks on government and security authorities. "Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War," his now-deleted tweet said. "Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand."  Twitter said Buhari's tweet violated its "abusive behaviour" policy, leading to a 12-hour suspension of his account. Buhari's comments follow increased attacks, particularly on government buildings and police stations in southeastern Nigeria, in recent weeks. Authorities have blamed the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) for the attacks. The banned IPOB has denied involvement in the attacks.
