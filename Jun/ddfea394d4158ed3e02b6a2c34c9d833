More than 19,000 people have signed an online petition to have popular musician Diamond Platnumz disqualified from the BET Awards. Diamond had been nominated for Best International Act and will be battling against other African artists including Burna Boy and Wizkid from Nigeria. The petitioners are accusing the singer of using his artistry and influence to publicly support the autocratic rule of the late president John Magufuli, who died in March. They argue that Diamond was a vocal supporter of Magufuli and that one of his songs was used during ruling party campaign rallies last year.
