Tanzania has recorded 100 new Covid-19 cases since the third wave of the disease broke out across the globe, with 70 of the 100 patients on ventilators and in a critical condition, President Samia Suluhu Hassan has said. It was the first time Tanzania had made Covid-19 statistics public since May 2020. The administration of late former president John Magufuli, was at some point denying the existence of Covid-19 in the country. Since Suluhu took office, the country has moved forward with a Covid-19 impact mitigation plan. The government will spend at least U.S.$470 million to purchase Covid-19 vaccines and bail out sectors that have been severely impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
