Nigerian activist Aisha Yesufu started participating in protests as a school student nearly three decades ago - but she says it has not been easy. Nigeria's female activists were on the front lines in the October 2020 mass #EndSARS protests against police brutality by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. However, she says that they do not always get the same recognition as their male counterparts. A viral picture of her kneeling with her clenched fist into the air, with heavily armed police officials charging toward protesters, became the movement's symbol. On describing the moment, she said: "I feared for my life." Nigerian culture, like many others in Africa, is highly patriarchal. But Vivian Bellonwu, founder of Social Action Nigeria, says things are changing gradually due to increasing levels of women's education. Last month, Nigeria's women's affairs minister, Pauline Tallen, moved for a constitutional review that would give women up to 35% representation in public offices. The current figure is just 7%.
