Authorities have said that at least six senior civil servants were kidnapped on June 15, 2021 by what Senior Divisional Officer for Ndian region, Lawrence Forwang called "secessionist terrorists". He said the kidnappers are demanding tens of millions of Central African CFA francs as ransom. The civil servants were on an official mission to demarcate land for an electricity supply plant project in the area. Forwang said that he has been in contact with one of the captives. Cameroon's English speaking northwest and southwest regions have been in the grip of a five-year deadly separatist conflict. More than 3,000 people have been killed and about 700,000 have been forced to flee their homes since the crisis morphed into an armed conflict in 2017.
