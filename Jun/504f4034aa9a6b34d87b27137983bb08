A new standoff between the Judiciary and the Executive has reportedly emerged after Chief Justice Martha Koome urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to appoint the remaining six judges Kenyatta left out when he made appointments. On June 3, President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed 34 judges leaving out six judges, among them justices Joel Ngugi and George Odunga who sat in a bench that declared the push to amend the constitution through the Building Bridges Initiative unconstitutional, in a historic ruling that has drawn appeals including from the president himself who accused the judges of robbing Kenyans their will. In an application, the Law Society of Kenya has said the swearing-in of the 34 Judges violates the constitution as well as the rights of the remaining six and wanted it stopped pending the appointment of all.
