The country is finalising preparations for the long-awaited June 21 poll, that was postponed in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The country's National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) had earlier said that constituencies affected by ballot paper defects will have hold elections on September 6, 2021 alongside 40 other constituencies where the NEBE previously said elections cannot take place due to security reasons and voters' registration irregularities. Polling will not take place as scheduled in all constituencies in the Somali region as well as in the South West Referendum. This as prominent Muslim cleric, Ahmedin Jebel, who was running for the House of People's Representatives for Jimma city, announced via a post on his facebook his withdrawal from the upcoming election. The U.S. State Department has said it was "gravely concerned about the environment under which these upcoming elections are to be held," and cited "the detention of opposition politicians, harassment of independent media, partisan activities by local and regional governments, and the many inter-ethnic and inter-communal conflicts across Ethiopia," as obstacles to a free and fair electoral process and whether Ethiopians would perceive them as credible."
