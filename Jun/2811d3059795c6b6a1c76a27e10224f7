The United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) Secretary General Zurab Pololikashvili has handed President Hage Geingob a presidential award in recognition of his strong commitment to fostering tourism as a key driver of sustainable and inclusive development. Pololikashvili visited Geingob to brief him on the two-day UNWTO regional conference on brand Africa. The conference, hosted by Namibia, themed "Strengthening Brand Africa for the Swift Recovery of the Tourism Sector", could only attract nine tourism ministers, 15 experts and stakeholders due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Pololikashvili told Geingob.
