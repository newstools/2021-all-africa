President Emmerson Mnangagwa has again been dragged to court by two top lawyers Eric Matinenga and Beatrice Mtetwa for assenting to a Bill giving him powers to control the judiciary. This is one of the many applications filed by individuals and others including the Young Lawyers Association of Zimbabwe, who feel aggrieved by the move. The Constitutional Amendment sparked public uproar after Mnangagwa went on to extend embattled Chief Justice Luke Malaba's retirement age from 70 to 75. Constitutional Amendment (No.2) Act allows the president to appoint the chief justice, deputy chief Justice and judge president without subjecting them to open selection processes.
