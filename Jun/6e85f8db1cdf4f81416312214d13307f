The Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment has declined three applications for the environmental authorisation for the development of gas to power via powerships - special purpose ships on which a power plant is installed to serve as a power generation resource. Organised business had called on the government to come up with an urgent 'Plan B' power crisis solution amid indications that the controversial Turkish powerships plan would unravel due to legal challenges involving alleged irregularities. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula was drawn into the multibillion-rand powerships controversy when it emerged that the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, Transnet and the Istanbul-controlled Karpowership SA group were apparently attempting to dodge another regulatory requirement by getting Mbalula's office to approve a shortcut to the normal application procedures.
