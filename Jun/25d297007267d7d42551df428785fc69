The security situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo has deteriorated over the past 25 years since the First Congo War. Peace has been fragile and several ceasefire agreements ineffectual, as have the many military operations carried out jointly against armed insurgents by the DR Congo and neighbouring countries. In fact the number of rebel fighters has increased, with foreign insurgents from neighbouring countries in the Great Lakes region joining their ranks. Given the lack of military success the time may now be ripe to open talks at the state and regional levels to try and resolve the conflict. A culture of impunity in some Great Lakes countries continues to be a problem. Previous attempts to end fighting in the region have given scant consideration to how perpetrators of grave violations of human rights can be brought to justice, writes Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza for Chatham House.
