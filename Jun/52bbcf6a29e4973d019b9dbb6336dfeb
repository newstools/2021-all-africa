Rights group Human Rights Watch has said that security forces in Chad have used excessive force, including indiscriminate live ammunition, to disperse opposition-led demonstrations across the country in the aftermath of the April 11, 2021 election. The watchdog also said during protests in late April and May 2021, at least seven people were killed and dozens were wounded - with security forces arresting more than 700 people, several of whom reported ill-treatment, including torture, while in detention.           Tensions have been high in Chad since President Idriss Déby's unexpected death - reportedly from injuries during clashes between militants and government forces in the western Kanem province. The army announced his death on April 20, 2021, the day after his re-election to a sixth teelectionrm - an election that was largely boycotted by the opposition who claimed widespread violence and repression. A transitional military council led by Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno, Déby's son, took over the country on April 20, 2021 but the council is facing both national and international criticism amid growing calls for a civilian-led transition and credible elections.
