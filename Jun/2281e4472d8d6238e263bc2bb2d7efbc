President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced that the goverment has secured the hosting rights of the elite motorsport event from the International Automobile Federation (FIA) and the World Rally Championship (WRC) for the next 5 years, after years of intense lobbying and preparations. The rally reportedly injected more than U.S.S$37 Million to the Nakuru economy with hotels reporting 100% bookings. Foreign drivers and their back-up teams and families came from as far as Europe, Asia, Africa and the U.S.  The gruelling event was won by French driver Sebastien Ogier followed by his Toyota teammate Takamoto Kasutsa of Japan while Hyundai's Ott Tanak of Estonia finished third. Top Kenyan drivers Onkar Rai, Karan Patel and Carl 'Flash' Tundo scored WRC points after finishing in the top 10 of the Safari Rally. Rai dedicated his maiden WRC3 race to his injured brother Tejveer, who crashed out of the event on June 25, 2021 and who is still receiving medical treatment.
