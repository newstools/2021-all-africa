Twenty-seven years after their triumph in Tunis, the former Super Eagles have been duly rewarded for their successful outing on the continent. President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the allocation of houses to the victorious Super Eagles squad that won the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations in Tunisia. The triumph was the Super Eagles' second Afcon title, after their maiden success in 1980 and their last was the 2013 edition which they won in South Africa.
