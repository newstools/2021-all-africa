A 28-year-old Kenyan migrant worker and activist based in Qatar who was recently arrested and detained in the Gulf nation on allegations of violating its security laws, is now in deeper trouble. Qatar has confirmed that Malcolm Bidali was formally charged with offences related to "payments received by a foreign agent for the creation and distribution of disinformation within the State of Qatar". Bidali has been held incommunicado for the past three weeks following his arrest, which came days after he spoke to human rights organisations on the continued abuse of migrant workers in the Arab country. Blogging under the pseudonym Noah, Bidali wrote about labour rights issues, including long working hours, low wages, poor working conditions and unsuitable accommodation, writes Hilary Kimuyu for The Nation.
