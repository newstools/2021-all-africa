President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed concern about new threats by the militant group the Niger Delta Avengers to bomb critical oil and gas infrastructure in the country. The group announced that they were planning to sabotage Nigeria's economy by attacking oil installation in the Niger Delta. The group also threatened to attack politicians "collaborating" with the Nigerian government to "undermine" the interests of the region. Presidential spokesperson Femi Adesina said that the threats were "unnecessary and uncalled for" as President Muhammadu Buhari had since engaged the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress, on how best to address the demands made by the group. The Niger Delta Avengers were responsible for most of the attacks on oil and gas facilities in 2016, resulting in the nation losing about half its oil production. The group suspended attacks in 2017 following interventions by regional leaders and pledges by the government to address development challenges facing the area.
