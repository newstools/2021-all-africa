World Blood Donor Day is celebrated every year on June 14 to promote awareness regarding need for safe blood.  The day also provides an opportunity to call on governments and national health authorities to provide adequate resources and put into place systems and infrastructure to increase the collection of blood from voluntary, non-remunerated blood donors. The need for blood is universal, but access to blood for all those who need it is not. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 90% of people who are eligible to donate blood are not currently doing so. For 2021, the World Blood Donor Day slogan will be "Give blood and keep the world-beating". The message highlights the essential contribution blood donors make to keeping the world pulsating by saving lives and improving others' health. It reinforces the global call for more people all over the world to donate blood regularly and contribute to better health.
