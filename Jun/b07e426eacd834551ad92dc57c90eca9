Migrants from other parts of the continent remain under threat in parts of South Africa, particularly in communities such as Diepkloof in Soweto. where dozens of people armed with whips and sticks gathered earlier in June determined to remove by force those they called "illegal foreign nationals". However, other groups of South Africans are seeking to build working-class solidarity between migrants and the poor communities who compete for resources. Meanwhile, the children of refugees and migrants, many of whom have never known any other home, have their own struggles to find jobs, education and recognition by bureaucrats. Jan Bornman reports for New Frame.
