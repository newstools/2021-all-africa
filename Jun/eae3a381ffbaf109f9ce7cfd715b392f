In nuanced examinations of the fighting in Cabo Delgado province, a range of analysts renew warnings against over-simpliflying the conflict as one of "jihadist terrorists" against a Western-oriented state which can be ended with military solutions alone.  The International Crisis Group says the authorities should deploy aid to build trust with locals and open dialogue with militants, while Southern African  governments should redouble law enforcement efforts to block transnational jihadist involvement. William Minter, who once taught in Frelimo schools during the liberation war, points to the failure of military solutions in Mali, Somalia and northeastern Nigeria. For his part, Joseph Hanlon, a long-time observer of Mozambique, points to the experiences of American police departments in the early 20th century in suggesting that compromises can be made with corrupt elites to secure peace.
