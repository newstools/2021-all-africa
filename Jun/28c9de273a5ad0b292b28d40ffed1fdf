RecyclePoints and the Mastercard Foundation are announcing a partnership to enable more than 8,000 women and young people to access work opportunities aimed at tackling the challenges associated with waste pollution and unemployment in underserved communities in Nigeria. The intervention aims to create green work for 410 youth, build resilience of 40 women-led MSMEs, and strengthen RecyclePoints' capacity to aggregate recycling waste that will benefit thousands of disadvantaged persons and communities who have been the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
