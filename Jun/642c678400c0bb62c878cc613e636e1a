A Constitutional Court ruling which found former president Jacob Zuma guitly of contempt of court has sent shockwaves through the African National Congress. The ruling party called on its supporters to remain calm, noting the event as a "difficult" moment. This comes after Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) spokesperson, Carl Niehaus called on people to protest and "not allow President Jacob Zuma to be arrested and imprisoned". The MKMVA further iterated that it was "outraged by the entirely unjustifiable and unjust" sentence handed down to Zuma and alleged that the law was being abused for factional political reasons. Meanwhile, Amnesty International's executive director, Shenilla Mohamed, said in a statement: "The judgment handed down by the Constitutional Court in the contempt of court matter is an important development for the rule of law. It is a reminder that no one is above the law, no matter who they are or their social or political status." The Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture also welcomed the judgment in a statement that read: "The Commission views the judgment as one of great importance for the rule of law, the principle of equality before the law, the primacy of our Constitution and the protection of our constitutional democracy."
