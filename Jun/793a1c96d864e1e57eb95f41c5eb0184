The Safari is a gift to Kenyans. It will be a break from the depressing news of the Covid-19 situation, deaths, inflation and political noise. The Safari and its attendant fanfare is expected to give the nation a collective lift to their spirits. A high sense of the task ahead has gripped Kenyans eight days before the start of the eagerly awaited rally from June 24-27, 2021. It is reportedly the biggest international sporting event on the continent since the 2010 Fifa World Cup in South Africa. Companies will unveil more drivers in the coming days, a great relief for their pockets considering the high cost of taking part in the Safari. Factory teams' cars from Toyota, Ford and Hyundai are expected at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport today, June 16, 2021 for testing outside the rally route, writes Peter Njenga for The Nation.
