Pressure is growing on leaders of the G7 club of rich nations consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the U.S. to provide more funding to deal with climate change and surplus Covid-19 vaccines for developing countries, as an act of global solidarity when they meet on June 11-13, 2021 in the UK. A new report by Amnesty International says that "the world's richest governments are condemning billions of people to starvation, drought and displacement through their continued support of the fossil fuel industry". The Elders, a group founded by South Africa's late president Nelson Mandela in 2007, made up of global independent leaders working for peace and human rights, have also added their voice, urging G7 leaders to "pledge new climate funding or risk further weakening the multilateral system, on which future progress and prosperity depends". Climate change is impacting communities and economies around the world, with among others, devastating floods, drought destroying crops, and an increase in pest infestation that is leading to famine in many parts of Africa. The Elders also urged the G7 leaders to take urgent action on Covid-19 vaccine distribution in Africa. This echoes calls made by African leaders, urging wealthier nations to assist those who need to acquire vaccines for their people.
