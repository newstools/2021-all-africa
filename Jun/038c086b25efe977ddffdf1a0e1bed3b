Nigeria's Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has said that the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has been re-arrested and brought back to Nigeria to face his trial. Kanu went missing when he failed to appear in court in 2015 and then fled the country in 2017 while on bail. Officials did not disclose where he was apprehended.  Kanu was initially arrested in 2015 on 11 counts including terrorism, treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal possession of firearms, and improper importation of goods, among others, Malami said. The Nigerian government obtained a court order on September 20, 2017, to designate IPOB as a terrorist group. Kanu has said that he fled the country to save his life.
