The government has confirmed that over one million Covid-19 vaccinations have been administered in its inoculation rollout plan. According to Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, the country has vaccinated 479,768 people under the Sisonke Programme, while at least 565,336 elderly people have received their first shot of the Pfizer jab. Calls have also been made for the government to prioritise the vaccination of educators following the Department of Education's decision to return learners to a full-time teaching schedule by the end of July.           This comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a shift to an adjusted Alert Level 2 lockdown from 31 May, as some provinces in the country are on the threshold of the third wave. As of June 2, 2021, the country has confirmed 1,669,231 cases of Covid-19 of which 56,601 proved fatal and 1,563,719 resulted in recovery.
