Nigeria celebrates Democracy Day on June 12. This new date was moved from March 29 by President Muhammadu Buhari, in commemoration of the June 12,1993 general election that was annulled by military leader Ibrahim Babangida. That election was won by M.K.O. Abiola who was imprisoned and died under suspicious circumstances before his release on July 7, 1998. While President Muhammadu Buhari has committed to "upholding and defending Nigeria's corporate existence", insecurity has seen the resurgence of attacks by militant groups Boko Haram and splinter group ISWAP as well as a rise in attacks by bandits on villages, leading to hundreds of people losing their lives or being displaced. The economy has also suffered several setbacks and with the Covid-19 pandemic, saw a sharp decline in oil revenue as world demand decreased and food price hikes that sparked protests. Nigeria was also brought to a standstill by Special Anti-Robbery Squad (#EndSARS) protests that saw authorities allegedly use live ammunition, killing several unarmed protesters. Nigeria has also seen corruption on the rise. The president in his speech, vowed that he would "do all within his power to constitutionally ensure that the security and welfare of all citizens remain the primary purpose of government". Protests against corruption and insecurity are being planned nationally today.
