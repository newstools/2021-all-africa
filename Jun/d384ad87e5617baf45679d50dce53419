The country's second budget under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic has prioritised a stimulus for economic recovery and the implementation of President Uhuru Kenyatta's legacy projects. In the president's last full financial year, the emphasis is clearly on finalising ongoing investments and creating a suitable environment for economic recovery to safeguard livelihoods. The agriculture sector, which has received a slightly bigger share of the budget, remains vital to the country's economic recovery strategy. The sector contributes 34% to gross domestic product. It has also recorded a relatively stronger performance than other sectors that have been adversely affected by the pandemic. However, challenges exist within the sector that calls for increased investments by both the public and private sectors.           The government must maintain political stability amid the push for a constitutional referendum before general elections in August 2022. In the past, electioneering - and the threat of instability - have been associated with economic slowdown, writes Timothy Njagi Njeru for The Conversation.
