President Yoweri Museveni, who has led Uganda since 1986, has appointed a woman, Jessica Alupo, as vice-president and another woman, Robinah Nabbanja, as prime minister. He has also increased the percentage of women in the cabinet from 27% to 43%. These appointments have sparked considerable debate in Uganda, reflecting both the constraints and the possibilities of women's rights reform in an authoritarian country. Freedom House ranks Uganda as a "Not Free" country. This is due to election violence and limits on political rights and civil liberties. After Museveni took over in 1986 following a brutal civil war, women's movements pushed for increases in women political representation at all levels. Today, women hold 46% of local government positions, 33% of parliamentary seats and 43% of the cabinet positions. The movement has also fought for, and won significant legal reforms. Historically women's rights and representation have been associated with democracies. The recent cabinet appointments of women in Uganda reflect a phenomenon one finds in Africa, where autocracies are as likely as democracies to promote women as leaders, writes Aili Mari Tripp, who is Wangari Maathai Professor of Political Science and Gender and Women's Studies and Chair of the Department of Gender and Women's Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison.
