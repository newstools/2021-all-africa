French forces in Mali say they have captured Dadi Ould Chouaib, also known as Abou Dardar, a man they describe as a "high-ranking fighter of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara". He was arrested on June 11, 2021 in the "tri-border" region between Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. Chouaib was carrying "an automatic weapon, a night vision telescope, a combat vest, a telephone and a radio", but surrendered without resistance. He was formerly a member of the Al-Qaeda-linked Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO), many of whose fighters joined Islamic State in the Greater Sahara".
