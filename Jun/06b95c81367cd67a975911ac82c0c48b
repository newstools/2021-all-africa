President Samia Suluhu Hassan has put to rest the debate on a new constitution, saying her priority is to stabilise Tanzania's economy. "Let's give ourselves more time, as we continue building up our economy. I don't say that the call for constitution is less important but we still have a lot of things to do as we strive to strengthen our economy. We want to continue bringing in more investors and creating more jobs," she said. The president was responding to a question regarding the shelved new constitution writing process, which kicked off during the fourth-phase government under former president Jakaya Kikwete. The proposed new constitution was to replace the current 1977 document. President Samia explained that currently her focus is to unlock the country's economic potential to raise individual and national incomes to improve livelihoods.
