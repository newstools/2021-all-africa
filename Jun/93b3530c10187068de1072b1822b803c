The case was heard by a full bench of the KwaZulu-Natal Division of the High Court in Pietermaritzburg, since December 9, 2020. Now, In a ruling that affects five million people in KwaZulu-Natal, the Pietermaritzburg High Court has ruled the Ingonyama Trust's land leases unlawful.The Zulu King's trust has been ordered to refund millions it collected on the leases, writes Tania Broughton for GroundUp.
