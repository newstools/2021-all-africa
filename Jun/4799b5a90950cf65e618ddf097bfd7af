The government has warned citizens of a third wave of Covid-19, warning that all precautions be taken, including the wearing of face masks. This comes a few days after Tanzania expressed its interest in joining the Covax global vaccine-sharing facility. While the health ministry's Leonard Subi reminded all citizens not to ignore Covid-19, a random survey conducted by The Citizen - on the same day the advisory was issued - showed that entertainment spots in a suburb like Tabata were packed by revellers who were dancing, hugging, not wearing face masks, nor sanitising or social distancing. Soon after president John Magufuli's death in March 2021, new President Samia Suluhu implemented a change in the handling of Covid-19 infections, including admitting its presence. Now the country is waiting for vaccines.
