Heads of state within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) met on June 23, 2021 as they attempt to come up with the best suitable regional response to address the ongoing insurgency in northern Mozambique. It is the third time in a matter of weeks that the SADC attempts to reach this crucial decision. There is still no clarity on Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi's thinking on a regional military intervention, though most commentators and analysts believe he remains reluctant since SADC and Mozambique have been batting the idea around for almost a year. The issue came to a head after a major assault by the insurgents on Palma in Mozambique's northernmost Cabo Delgado province, at the end of March 2021.
