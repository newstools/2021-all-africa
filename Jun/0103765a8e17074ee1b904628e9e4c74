Namibian hospitals are at full capacity, the health ministry said as the southern African nation battles a surge in Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, the government is facing a critical shortage of lifesaving oxygen at state hospitals due to the collapse of the oxygen generating systems at health facilities countrywide. As at June 4, 2021, Namibia had 56,981 confirmed cases, including 51,177 recoveries and 877 deaths. To date, more than 70,585 people have received their first dose, but only 10,000 have been fully vaccinated.
