President Muhammadu Buhari is travelling to London for another medical check-up, three months after a  previous trip was met with public criticism when doctors in Nigeria were on strike and as the public health service remains severely underfunded. The president, who has spent six years in office, has been receiving treatment for an undisclosed ailment - with many calling it medical tourism. Buhari is due back in Nigeria in the second week of July, his office said.
