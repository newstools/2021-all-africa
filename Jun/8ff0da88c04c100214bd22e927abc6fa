Samia Suluhu Hassan made history when she was sworn in as the first female president of Tanzania following the death of her predecessor, President John Magufuli. Observers agree that the political temperature has gone down under the new leadership compared to the five years under late president John Magufuli. She has also pledged to promote freedom of expression. Suluhu Hassan has traveled twice to Uganda and made a two-day official visit to Kenya. The relations between Kenya and Tanzania had earlier been strained under Magufuli's leadership. The two countries had disputes on cross-border trade, tariffs, among others. In Kenya, Suluhu Hassan sought to press the reset button with her counterpart President Uhuru Kenyatta. Suluhu Hassan is steadily steering Tanzania to tackle Covid-19 after months of inaction.
