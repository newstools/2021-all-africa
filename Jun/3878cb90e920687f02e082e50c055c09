The Angolan government is engaged in the creation of policies aimed at safeguarding the rights of refugees and asylum seekers to ensure their integration into society, Ana Celeste, the state secretary for human rights said at the National Conference on Situation of Refugees in Angola. "Refugees in Angola enjoy the same rights and the same basic assistance as any legal resident," she said. Data from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees reveals that there are 56,297 refugees in Angola. In May 2017, Angola reported the most migratory movement, after over 35,000 citizens from DR Congo sought refuge in Angola, mainly in the province of Lunda Norte. Until 2020, the Angolan government and UNHCR repatriated over 14,000 refugees. Despite all this effort, 9,622 refugees remain in the Angolan territory.
