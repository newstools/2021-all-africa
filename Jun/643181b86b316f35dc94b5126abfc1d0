After a two-day discussion by the National Consultative Forum, comprising of the federal fovernment of Somalia, the five federal member states and the mayor of Mogadishu, Prime Minister Hussein Roble's organising team announced that the much-delayed presidential election will be held on October 10, 2021. The meeting took place at the "big tent"'  - a facility inside Mogadishu's Aden Abdulle International Airport - which is guarded by peacekeepers operating under the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom).           According to Somalia's chosen indirect election model, the presidential election is attained through a vote by members of the Lower House and senators of the Upper House. Incumbent Mohamed Farmaajo, whose official term in office lapsed on February 8, 2021 is expected to announce his candidacy and to emerge as a strong candidate.
