Authorities in Sudan should speed up investigations into the killing of at least 100 protesters outside the military headquarters in the days following the overthrow of former president Omar al-Bashir. Thousands of peaceful protesters camped outside the military headquarters in the capital Khartoum demanding a transition to a civilian government when they were attacked by a combination of security forces from the Rapid Support Forces, the National Intelligence and Security Service and the police, using live bullets, whips, sticks and teargas. Since December 2018, large protests were organised to pressure al Bashir to step down. In April 2019 the leader was deposed in a military coup. However, protesters continued to occupy the space in front of the Ministry of Defence, demanding that the military cede power to civilian rule.
