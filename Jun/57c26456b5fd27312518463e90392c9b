President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party has reportedly taken the first step within party structures in its bid to forge a coalition with opposition leader Raila Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). Jubilee officials have tabled proposals for the coalition with ODM before the party's National Management Committee for ratification. Deputy Secretary General Joshua Kuttuny, who attended the meeting at the party's headquarters in Nairobi, told The Nation that "a wide range of issues were discussed, including coalitions with like-minded parties". Five negotiators will represent each party while the respective executive directors are poised to be the joint secretaries. This development comes a month after the High Court declared the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) illegal, null and void, dealing a death knell to Kenyatta and Odinga's four-years-long efforts to change the constitution.
