Over the years, the Nigerian government has taken several measures to try and deal with the various conflicts. The most pronounced has been the deployment of the army to improve the security situation. But this has not managed to stem the various sources of conflict, writes Oluwole Ojewale for The Conversation.  North-central Nigeria, known as the Middle Belt, is home to the country's capital city Abuja and six other states - Benue, Plateau, Kogi, Nasarawa, Niger, and Kwara. The region is volatile and highly susceptible to militia attacks and sectarian crises. There are also frequent clashes between pastoralists and sedentary farmers. According to Ojewale, to establish and maintain mechanisms to promote peace, tolerance, solidarity, and respect for each another -  for instance - in Benue and Plateau States, communities partnered with state-based civil society organisations. These partnerships led to the establishment of an accountability forum for fostering dialogue among pastoralists and farmers.  Numerous programmes and activities by non-governmental agencies are attempting to provide support efforts geared towards building community resilience. But there's scant evidence of a truly supportive political effort to assist these efforts.
