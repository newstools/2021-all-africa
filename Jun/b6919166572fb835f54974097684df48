After two months of waiting since they received their 2020 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education results in April 2021, a few learners who were selected to join schools of their choice are celebrating while thousands who were placed in institutions that they did not even select have been thrown into a dilemma over their next move. Some parents are complaining that their children have been placed in day schools that were too far away from their homes, making it impossible for them to commute. Education cabinet secretary, George Magoha, announced that all the 8,091 candidates who scored 400 marks and above had been admitted to national and extra-county schools. Magoha described the competition for the top schools as "ridiculous". He announced that the Form One students will report to school on August 2, 2021, one week after the other learners report for term one.
