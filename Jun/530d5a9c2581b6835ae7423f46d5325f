As weeks-long protests spread throughout eSwatini in recent days, South Africa's public broadcaster, the SABC, reported that King Mswati III had left the country. However, a SABC reporter quoted a government spokesman as saying "the King has not fled the country due to the unrest." Demonstrations against the authoritarian monarchy have escalated since the shooting in the eye of a student in mid-May. Swazi Media Commentary reported that marches took place in at least 10 locations, mainly in rural areas despite a ban placed by the king on pro-democracy demonstrations. The government-supporting eSwatini Observer reported that protesters tried to invade acting Prime Minister Themba Masuku's residence. It also said the country's police chief blamed a member of Parliament for "chaos" at another protest. Swaziland News reported that the MP was one of two pro-democracy legislators whose arrest has been ordered by the king. However, a local human rights lawyer said the police allegedly  refused to carry out the arrest, and that the king had to order the army to do so.
