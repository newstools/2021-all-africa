When performing artists die it often emerges that were struggling financially, leaving families with a heavy burden and questions. Many artists live from hand to mouth, and from one gig to another. No work means no pay and, as result, there have been depressing tales of performing artists who have to work while sick to keep the wolf at bay or who died without a cent to their names, writes Letlhokwa George Mpedi for the Daily Maverick.  The recent passing of the legendary actress, Shaleen Surtie-Richards highlights the plight of performing artists once again, after reports that she could not afford to book herself into a hospital due to resource constraints. Veteran actress Florence Masebe is among the many actors who are steadfast in her fight for audiovisual performers to be paid royalties.
