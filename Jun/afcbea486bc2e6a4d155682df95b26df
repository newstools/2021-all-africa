Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's first president and a key figure in its independence struggle, has died at the age of 97. He was admitted to a hospital in the capital Lusaka on June 14 suffering from pneumonia. In the 1950s, Kaunda was a key figure in what was then Northern Rhodesia's independence movement from Britain. After retiring, he was involved in various charitable organisations. His most notable contribution was his zeal in the fight against the spread of HIV/AIDS.
