Namibia, reeling from a spike in new Covid-19 cases and deaths, has announced a waiver of customs duty on oxygen imports to improve supply. The move is part of government efforts to ease shortages at the country's referral and private hospitals, which have been struggling to meet rising demand. "The country is facing the worst crisis as a result of the pandemic, which has claimed close to 1,200 lives in Namibia to date", said President Hage Geingob, during a visit to Katutura Intermediate Hospital and Windhoek Central Hospital, where he assessed the availability of oxygen. As of June 25, confirmed cases of Covid-19 from 55 African countries reached 5,314,835 while over 32,500,561 vaccinations have been administered across the continent.
