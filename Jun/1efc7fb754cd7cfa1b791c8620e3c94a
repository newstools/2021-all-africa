Nigeria's people have over the years had to contend with so many challenges - insecurity, conflict, kidnappings, the continuous attacks by the extremist group Boko Haram, issues of governance, corruption and unemployment. But there are those doing what they can to help bring about peace and stability to the country.      allAfrica's series on peacebuilding in Africa addresses some of this with these workers for peace - Dr Fatima Akilu, Dr Adedeji Adreniran, Dr Emeka Njoku, and Mustapha Saeed. We suggest you read allAfrica's analysis Can the Nigerian State Survive the Twin Crises of Covid and Conflict? before listening to the podcast. AllAfrica's reporting on peacebuilding across Africa is supported by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, philanthropy supporting innovations in education, democratic engagement, and strengthening international peace and security.
