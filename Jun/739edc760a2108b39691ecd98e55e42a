Nairobi and Mogadishu have agreed to have their respective ambassadors return to duty, ending six months of frosty relations. But they must now move to address issues largely left unattended to when they each withdrew their diplomats in December 2020 after Somalia accused Kenya of interference in Mogadishu's internal political affairs. According to a shared press release by both governments, "the two leaders agreed to keep bilateral diplomatic channels of communications open between the two capitals in all matters of future strategic diplomatic relations." This is a welcome gesture for the region because since December 2020, the two countries had largely been having indirect communication, often through third parties like Qatar who helped mediate through the tension. The two countries also have a pending maritime dispute which is awaiting a final verdict at the International Court of Justice, writes Aggrey Mutambo for The Nation.
