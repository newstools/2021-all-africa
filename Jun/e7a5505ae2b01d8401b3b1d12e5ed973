Up to 69% of the new 15,248 Covid-19 cases detected nationally in Uganda, were reported since June 3, 2021 with a total of 15 deaths by June 12, 2021. Statistics from the Ministry of Health for the last 10 days (June 3 -12) indicate that 10,491 cases were reported, compared to the previous 10 days (May 24 - June 2), where only 4,757 cases were reported. The cumulative total of Covid-19 cases in the country is 60,250. This comes days after President Yoweri Museveni closed schools and worship centres and suspended public gatherings for six weeks, as part of measures to cushion the country from a new wave of Covid-19. Richard Idro, the president of the Uganda Medical Association, said health workers are stretched and warned that the country was heading for an oxygen crisis as seen in India with the Covid-19 surge there.
