Novelist, playwright, filmmaker, and activist Tsitsi Dangarembga has been awarded the PEN Pinter Prize 2021 for her "ability to capture and communicate vital truths even amidst times of upheaval". The PEN Pinter Prize was established in 2009 by the charity English PEN, which defends freedom of expression and celebrates literature. Dangaremba was arrested by authorities in 2020 in Harare while protesting against corruption, and was later released on bail.
