Smallholder tea farmers in southwestern Kenya are reportedly finally getting recognition after the government recently revised laws governing the subsector. They are now getting better returns for their crops, having a say in who represents them and are being paid on time for what is the country's primary export. The reforms put in place in March 2021, have created measures meant to cushion the farmers against exploitation. What's key is the change of the electoral systems of farmers' representatives, otherwise known as directors, as well as the replacement of marketing rules covering tea, according to Nyamira County Commissioner Amos Mariba.
