Zimbabweans have urged the government to urgently assist, and rescue the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority to avert the increase in power cuts and avoid an economic downturn. This comes as power outages resurfaced across the country with some areas without power for more than six hours daily. In April 2021, Zimbabwe and Russia signed an agreement that would see the Russians assist in setting up a nuclear power station to provide alternative sources of energy. The country has been struggling with power shortages since April 2019, when water levels in the Zambezi River dropped sharply due to drought, crippling the country's biggest hydroelectricity supplier, Kariba South Power Station.
