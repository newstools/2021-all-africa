In February 2021, a taskforce sent by Lagos state's New Towns Development Authority (NTDA) started bulldozing all the structures in the coastal neighbourhood of Oke-Egan, evicting occupants. The demolitions were the latest in a string of evictions that have occurred over the past five years as the Lagos government clears slums, homes built on lagoons and other informal settlements. Residents say in its push to create more housing, the government is destroying their homes without relocating or compensating them. Lagos is home to more than 20 million people and about 70% are living in informal settlements, according to the latest government estimates. Olakunle Aboyeji, general manager of the NTDA, said that "they plan to develop, not demolish."
