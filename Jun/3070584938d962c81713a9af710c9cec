Chief pathologist John Obafunwa has told the Lagos State Judicial Panel on restitution for victims of Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS)-related abuses and other matters, that post mortem autopsies were conducted on 99 bodies after the #EndSARS protests. He confirmed that three of the bodies were those of victims of the Lekki shootings. There were allegations and counter-allegations on the number of people killed during the incident but the military authorities and the government denied that there were deaths. The panel, which adjourned till June 19, ordered the pathologist to produce the records and autopsy reports of the remaining 96 bodies. In October 2020, thousands took to the streets under the slogan #EndSARS to protest against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, which they accuse of murder, torture, and extortion. Several protesters have appeared before the judicial panel to give evidence that many people were killed at the Lekki tollgate and many others injured. The Nigerian Army initially denied its soldiers shot at unarmed protesters. Amnesty International has accused Nigerian authorities of a cover-up in the Lekki Toll Gate deaths
