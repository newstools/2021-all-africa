The Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC) has on Friday 28th May 2021 concluded its public hearings. Three hundred and ninety-two witnesses testified before the Truth Commission to give evidence of the human rights violations that took place during the reign of former President Yahya Jammeh. The National Assembly of the Republic of The Gambia enacted a law (TRRC Act, 2017) which established the TRRC whose main objectives are to create an impartial historical record of violations and abuses of human rights from July 1994 to January 2017, in order to promote healing and reconciliation, respond to the needs of the victims, address impunity, and prevent a repeat of the violations and abuses suffered by making recommendations for the establishment of appropriate preventive mechanisms including institutional and legal reforms. The Commission's objective was also to establish and make known the fate or whereabouts of disappeared victims; provide victims an opportunity to relate their own accounts of the violations and abuses suffered, and grant reparations to victims in appropriate cases.
