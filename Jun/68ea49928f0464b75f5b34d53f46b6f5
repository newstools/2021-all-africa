Voters in the self-proclaimed republic of Somaliland, have gone to the polls on May 31, 2021 to elect their parliamentary and local representatives. Long queues have been reported in the capital city Hargeisa, as more than 1 million people registered to vote - a record in Somaliland. The previous presidential election in November 2017 recorded just over 700,000 registered voters, according to government figures. Somaliland has held six popular elections, and three presidential elections since 2003. But this will be only the second time that the country is holding parliamentary elections. The current members of parliament were elected in 2005, but quotas, the allocation of seats and the prioritising of presidential electoral laws delayed parliamentary elections multiple times, observers have said.
