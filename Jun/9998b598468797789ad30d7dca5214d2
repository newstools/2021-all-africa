Gambia national football team players have boycotted a meeting with President Adama Barrow, over the government's failure to fulfil its promise of paying them bonuses for qualifying for the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). The Scorpions will be making their first appearance ever in the continental tournament when they play in Cameroon in 2022. Sports Minister Bakary Badjie confirmed that U.S.$217,000 is what the government is prepared to give the players but rumour has it that they are feeling insulted by the offer. The minister has said he was unaware that the players were upset.
