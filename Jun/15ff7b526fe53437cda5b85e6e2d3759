The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has said that it is currently considering a stake in a number of privately-owned refineries which produces in excess of 50,000 barrels of oil per day. This is in line with the Nigeria government's policy directive that states the mandatory participation of the corporation in such entities, to safeguard national energy security, writes Emmanuel Addeh for This Day. The corporation has also said it wants a 20% stake in the Dangote Refinery in Lagos which produces 650,000 barrels of oil per day.
