The University of Lagos has performed tests of its Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV). According to the institution's Deputy Vice-Chancellor, (Academics and Research), Oluwole Familoni, the vehicle's production is an invaluable addition to the university's efforts at preventing the release of toxic emissions to the environment. Familoni added that  the vehicle runs on an improvised refurbished Nickel Hydride battery that delivers up to five-kilometre range per charging cycle when operated in Campus Shuttle mode, saying: "The range is extendable to 350km at optimum average speed of 110k/hour at highway mode, when appropriate lithium ion battery is installed." The ZEV comes three years after fellow institution the University of Nigeria unveiled a five-seater electric car comprised of 80% locally-sourced materials and capable of a 30-kilometer range when fully charged.
