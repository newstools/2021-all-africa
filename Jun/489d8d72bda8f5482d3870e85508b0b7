Abby Tijani, the director-general of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, has said that the German, Nigerian and British governments have agreed to build a museum in Edo State to house all returned Benin Bronzes. The Benin Bronzes are a group of more than a thousand metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin. Most of them were looted by British forces during the Benin Expedition of 1897. Most European former colonial powers have begun a process in recent years of considering the return of looted artifacts to the former colonies, especially in Africa.
