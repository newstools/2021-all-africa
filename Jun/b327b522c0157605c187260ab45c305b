Although Zimbabwe has been doing quite well compared to others in the region in vaccinating its people against Covid-19, hundreds of Zimbabweans have protested the  shortage of Covid-19 vaccines as the country awaits more doses from China. The government wants to innoculate at least 60% of Zimbabwe's more than 14 million people by the end of 2021 but is struggling to obtain the necessary supplies. As at June 3, 2021, Zimbabwe had 39,031 confirmed cases, including 36,661 recoveries and 1,599 deaths. To date, more than 656,630 people have received their first dose, but coverage of the crisis caused by the coronavirus variant in India will likely prompt fears of a third wave.
