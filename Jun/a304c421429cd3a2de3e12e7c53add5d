The study by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) Wellcome Trust Research Programme comes as Kenya seeks an alternative malaria treatment given the emergence of resistance to Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs) in South East Asia. The researchers sought to compare standard treatment regimens against double and triple drug combinations to determine their safety and tolerability. Scientists at the research facility also believe that the possibility of the multi drug-resistant malaria parasites spreading to the Indian subcontinent and to Sub-Saharan Africa as has been the case with chloroquine and sulfadoxine- pyrimethamine (Fansidar) is an ongoing concern. In addition, novel antimalarial compounds that would be used to develop new drugs to combat the multidrug-resistant parasites are not likely to be registered within the next five years, writes Leon Lidigu for The Nation.
