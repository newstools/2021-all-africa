From concerns over possible side effects to mixed messages about expiry dates, vaccine hesitancy has become a roadblock in Africa's inoculation drive for the public, a trend that extends to hesitant health care workers in some countries. This as many countries' fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic is already challenged by vaccine shortages and weak health care infrastructure, hesitancy regarding the available vaccines in Africa is also slowing down inoculation drives, acting as another obstacle in bringing down the number of new cases. In Cameroon, authorities are battling vaccine hesitancy with only 11% of doses received since April, dispensed, most of them due to travel requirements. Cameroon's government and clergy have been struggling to get the public to accept that the vaccines are safe. Meanwhile, in Malawi, President Lazarus Chakwera has led a push for a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, with a strong call to Malawians to go for vaccination to prevent a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The call comes after health authorities in Malawi announced the presence of the more contagious variant - first found in India in the country, which has infected over a dozen people.
