Uganda, Africa's largest refugee host, is imposing restrictions on movement after another spike in Covid-19 cases. This is creating an even greater economic struggle for the vulnerable in urban areas. One refugee, Noella Kabale from the DR Congo, is finding a way to overcome that struggle and help other refugees. Kabale and her team use polythene bags, using leftover material to sew items such as masks and sanitary towels. Living hand-to-mouth after arriving in Uganda in 2011, Kabale received vocational hands-on training for arts and crafts and eventually formed the Refugee Entrepreneurship Association with her small savings. The association consists mainly of divorced women, single mothers and youths - many of whom are victims of gender-based violence. Most of the products made by the women are sold online and during functions, and that money is ploughed back into the association. Uganda is home to about 1.5 million refugees, 92,000 of whom live in urban areas.
