The Director of the Refugees Services Department in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Sudi Mwakibasi, said the international community should intervene and see how they can support the creation of a good living environment in Burundi so that refugees would not be tempted to return to Tanzania. Belgium's Ambassador to Tanzania Peter Van Acker stressed that repatriation of refugees should be voluntary and pledged that they will continue to campaign and mobilise resources to support Tanzania in refugee operations.
