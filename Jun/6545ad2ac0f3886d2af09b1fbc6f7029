Uganda's new novel coronavirus lockdown restrictions through the end of July 2021, is squeezing many people's ability to earn a living. Street market vendors are forced to cycle, walk long distances or just sleep in the market. With Covid-19 infections soaring and hospitals overwhelmed, Uganda has reimposed a lockdown on transport, with busses shut down, permits needed to drive, and only essential workers allowed into Kampala. While the aim is to save lives, making a living is once again a struggle for traders  like Saudha Namaga, one of many forced to sleep at the market where she sells goods. She wants President Yoweri Museveni to ease the restrictions. With Uganda's first lockdown in March 2020, the government gave flour and beans to the urban poor - a gesture which many hope will be repeated. Uganda has 75,537 Covid-19 cases with 50,350 recoveries and 781 deaths, as at June 25, 2021.
