French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting a high-level Libya conference. The meetings will centre around Libya's presidential elections, planned for December 24, 2021 and parliamentary elections, two months later.           Libya's presidential and legislative elections are at the heart of a UN plan to help restore stability in the North African country, which has been mired by civil war since the overthrow of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in a 2011 uprising.           Macron is joined by leaders from some 20 states including U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.           In Paris, Libya will be represented by Mohamed al-Menfi, the head of the transitional presidential council that carries out head-of-state functions ahead of the elections, as well as Prime Minister Abdelhamid Dbeibah.
