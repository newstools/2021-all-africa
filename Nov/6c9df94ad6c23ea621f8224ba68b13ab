The House of Representatives has passed into law the Dual Citizenship Bill. The bill will amend or repeal some parts of the Aliens and Nationality Law of Liberia.           The bill is sponsored by House member Acarous Moses Gray who is chairperson of the executive committee. It is believed that the bill will satisfy the constitutional provision in Article 2 of the 1986 Liberian Constitution, which states: "any laws, treaties, statutes, decrees customs and regulations found to be inconsistent with it shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void and of no legal effect". The Supreme Court of Liberia had earlier ruled it unconstitutional that a citizen of Liberia, who for whatsoever reason became a citizen of another country, be automatically stripped off his/her Liberian citizenship without due process.  President George Weah described the decision as as momentous.
