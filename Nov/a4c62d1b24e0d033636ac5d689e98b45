The World Health Organisation's six special envoys on the Covid-19 pandemic say that responses work best if built on coordination and solidarity but collaboration between nations is inconsistent and not sustained. Noting that it is vital to learn from what has happened in the last two years, the envoys call for support for WHO member nations as they work towards an international legally binding agreement for preparing better responses to disease outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. To consider the merits of a new agreement for pandemic preparedness and response, these nations have called for a Special Session of the World Health Assembly, starting on 29 November, 2021.
