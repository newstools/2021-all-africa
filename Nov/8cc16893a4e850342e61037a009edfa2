The State Department said that on November 17, 2021 in Kenya, Blinken will discuss with President Uhuru Kenyatta and other officials "shared interests as members of the U.N. Security Council, including addressing regional security issues, such as Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan.

Blinken's last visit will be with Senegalese President Macky Sall in Dakar "to reaffirm the close partnership between our two countries," the agency said.
