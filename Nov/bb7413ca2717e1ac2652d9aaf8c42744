Queues to buy fuel have returned to Nigerian cities, with many motorists finding it difficult as many petrol stations are either closed or only partially in operation. The scarcity comes amid reports of a likely price increase by marketers. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has denied that the government is planning a hike and advised against panic buying. In addition, the NNPC stated that more petroleum products was expected to arrive in the country daily over the coming weeks and months, insisting that it was unnecessary to entertain any scarcity fears during and beyong the festive season.  Meanwhile, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria has set up a task force to ensure that filling stations are not hoarding petrol.
