The African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), which has been served as the centerpiece of the U.S.-Africa commercial relationship for more than two decades, will expire on September 30, 2025. "While the legislation's unilateral trade preferences have provided economic benefits for countries across sub-Saharan Africa, Agoa as a whole remains underutilized," three trade experts write. "To ensure continuity in U.S-African trade ties, the United States must grapple with the legislation's potential reauthorization now, with a particular focus on how the utilization of AGOA      might be improved."           On November 17, the U.S. House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee held a two-hour hearing examining how the trade relationship can be strengthened, with testimony from Florizelle (Florie) Liser, President and Chief Executive Officer, Corporate Council on Africa; Witney Schneidman, Nonresident Fellow, The Brookings Institution; Rosa Whitaker, President and Chief Executive Officer, The Whitaker Group; and CJ Mahoney, Deputy General Counsel, Microsoft.
