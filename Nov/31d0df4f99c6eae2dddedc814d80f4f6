The leaders of six regional organisations in Africa are calling for stronger governance to fight antimicrobial resistance, or AMR, on the eve of World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, from November 18-24, 2021. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in Africa - where micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites are resistant to antimicrobial treatment - is complicating the management of many infectious diseases, and endangers animal health and welfare, food production, safety and security.           Addressing AMR requires an holistic and multi-sectoral approach. World Antimicrobial Awareness Week (WAAW) in Africa aims to encourage best practices among the public, health workers, farmers, animal health professionals and policy makers to prevent further emergence and spread of drug-resistant infections in people and animals, WHO reports.
