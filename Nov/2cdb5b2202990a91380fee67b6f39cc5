In November 2020, forces of the Tigray People's Liberation Front attacked a federal army base in the region. The attack led to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's order of a military offensive against the rebels, which has left thousands dead. A year later, the conflict in the Tigray region has been described by UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo as reaching "disastrous proportions". Meanwhile, the African Union envoy for the Horn of Africa and former Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, has warned that "the window of opportunity is closing for a political resolution of the crisis in northern Ethiopia". On November 8, 2021 the AU Peace and Security Council had convened an emergency session under the title 'update on the situation in Northern Ethiopia' days after the national defence force called on former army officers to register "to thwart the ongoing assault".  Also on November 8, 2021 thousands of demonstrators flocked to a pro-government rally on Meskel Square, Addis Ababa's main gathering place.
