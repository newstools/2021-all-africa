A team of researchers has announced that they had found the partial remains of the skull of a four to six-year-old Homo naledi child, in a difficult-to-reach part of the Rising Star Cave system in the Cradle of Humankind located northwest of Johannesburg. The skull, with both baby and permanent teeth erupting, has been named "Letimela" or Leti meaning "the lost one" in the Setswana language. Marina Elliott - researcher on physical and biological anthropology at Simon Fraser University in Canada, and lead author on the paper of the discovery published in the Open Access journal, PaleoAnthropology - described how and where the skull was discovered, about the painstaking and physically demanding work involved in bringing Leti to the surface. "The discovery came out of explorations that we conducted in 2017, trying to understand more about the physical spaces in the Dinaledi sub-system ... I think there is likely a lot more to find in the cave system. There may be other locations of H. naledi material, but there is also a lot of work that still needs to be done."
