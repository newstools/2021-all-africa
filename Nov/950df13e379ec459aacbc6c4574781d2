At least 69 people, including a mayor, have been killed in an attack by gunmen in southwestern Niger, the government has confirmed.  AFP reports that the assault took place on November 2, 2021 at Adab-Dab, a village about 55km from Banibangou in the western region of Tillaberi, a source said.  Al Jazeera reports that the assault was the latest in Niger's "tri-border" zone with Burkina Faso and Mali, a volatile area that has been the epicentre of conflict between state forces and armed groups linked to Islamic State and Al Qaeda.
