South African scientists have detected a new Covid-19 variant that is posing a "major threat" to efforts to curb the virus, officials announced at a press conference on November 25, 2021. Health Minister Joe Phaahla said the variant, called B.1.1.529, was behind an "exponential" increase in reported cases in the country. "[It] is now a variant of serious concern which driving the spike in numbers," said Phaahla. Virologists have detected almost 100 cases linked to the variant in the country.           B.1.1.529 has multiple mutations and it could help it evade the body's immune response and make it more transmissible, scientists warned.While the delta variant has two mutations and the beta variant has three - the B.1.1.529 variant has at least 32 spike protein mutations, Deutsche Welle reports.            The British government has placed South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia on its travel red list, and has temporarily banned flights from these six countries.           CNBC reports that World Health Organization is monitoring the new variant and is scheduling a special meeting on Friday November 26, 2021 to discuss what it may mean for vaccines and treatments. "We don't know very much about this yet. What we do know is that this variant has a large number of mutations. And the concern is that when you have so many mutations, it can have an impact on how the virus behaves," Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, said in a social media question-and-answer session.
