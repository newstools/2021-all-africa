The international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has launched a new programme to treat malnourished children in the state of Katsina, in the northwest of Nigeria, as conflict and insecurity surge in the region and access to health care remains limited. Malnutrition is endemic in northern Nigeria, with cases usually declining by October, though this year MSF teams are continuing to see alarmingly high levels. MSF is working in collaboration with the Nigerian Ministry of Health to run a 62-bed inpatient therapeutic treatment centre (ITFC) in Katsina City, as well as five ambulatory therapeutic treatment centres (ATFCs) - one in Katsina City and the other four in Jibia Local Government Area - close to the border with Niger Republic, where many parents from Nigeria are seeking care for their malnourished children. The northwest of the country, including Katsina State, is currently witnessing a wave of violence, with kidnappings for ransom common, and frequent confrontations between various armed groups and Nigerian forces.
