Uganda was shaken by twin blasts in Kampala on November 16, 2021, carried out by suicide bombers who reportedly died instantly. Islamic State militants have claimed responsibility for the blasts which occurred near the parliamentary buidlings.  President Yoweri Museveni in his address at parliament on November 16, 2021, said the terrorists have exposed themselves at a time when Uganda's security infrastructure has improved. He said: "they have exposed themselves when we are more ready for urban terrorism. They will perish". This incident follows a blast at a restaurant in Kampala in which one person died and seven were injured on October 23, 2021.
