Despite fears of an impact by Covid-19 restrictions and the advent of bad weather in parts of the country, South Africans took to the polls to vote in the 2021 local government elections. However, voter turnout was noticably lower with only 48% of the nation's eligible voters estimated to have gone to the polls in comparison to 57% in 2016. Amanda Gouws, a political science professor at Stellenbosch University, said, "The issue, of course, is that people are fed up with political parties. They are fed up with empty promises but rather than punishing parties by going to vote for another party, they just stay away." "What this means," she added, "is that in a proportional system, none of the bigger parties get 50% of the vote or more, and then we have coalition governments. And as we know we don't do coalitions well." South Africa entered coalition politics in a big way in the aftermath of the 2016 municipal elections. Coalitions were formed in eight out of the nine provinces, leaving only Mpumalanga as the only province never to have experienced a municipal coalition government.
