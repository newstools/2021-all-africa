The Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution at the Lagos Court of Arbitration has investigated the Lekki tollgate shooting in Lagos in 2020. Nigerian security forces opened fire on young people who were protesting peacefully against alleged police brutality. In a report that took more than a year to produce, army officers were found to have shot, injured and killed unarmed, helpless and defenseless protesters, without provocation or justification, while they were waving the Nigerian flag and singing the national anthem. The manner of assault and killing could in context be described as a massacre, the report said. In October 2020, thousands of Nigerians took to the streets under the slogan #EndSARS to protest against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, whom they accused of murder, torture, and extortion. A new unit, the Special Weapons and Tactics Team (SWAT), was formed to replace the controversial, disbanded SARS.
