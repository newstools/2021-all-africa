UN Special Representative Volker Perthes, has told journalists in New York that multiple mediation efforts are underway, one week after the military coup in Sudan.             "Many of the interlocutors we are speaking with in Khartoum, but also internationally and regionally, are expressing a strong desire that we move forward quickly to get out of the crisis and return to the steps of normalcy, to the steps of political transition, as we viewed it before October 25, 2021, on the basis of the Constitutional Declaration,"   Perthes said.           The UN envoy has met several times with Prime Minister Hamdok, who is no longer detained but under house arrest at his residence. Though physically well, Perthes said Hamdok "is not free".           On October 25, 2021 the Sudanese army dissolved the power-sharing transitional government and detained civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and his cabinet. The coup took place as Sudan was progressing along a democratic path following ouster of longstanding leader, President Omar al-Bashir, in April 2019.
