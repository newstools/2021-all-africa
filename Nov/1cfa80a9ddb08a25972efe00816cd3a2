AllAfrica's Silence The Guns series focuses on peacebuilding on the continent. Today we take a closer look at the role of women and youth in peacebuilding in Africa. There's no question that the role of women and youth in building peace is extremely valuable, and supporting them to play a part in society is a step in the right direction. Today allAfrica's Mantsadi Sepheka discusses these issues with Foundation for Security and Development in Africa's Program and Research Manager Theodora Williams Anti, and Erasmus Migyikra Ndemole from the West Africa Centre for Peace in Ghana.
