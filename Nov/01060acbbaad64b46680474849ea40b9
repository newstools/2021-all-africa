The process to grant parole to Oscar Pistorius, who has served half of his 13-year-5 month sentence for shooting dead his lover Reeva Steenkamp, has begun, Radio France Internationale reports. Correction Services officials have approached Steenkamp's parents Barry and June to gauge their willingness to speak to Pistorius who made history at the 2012 London Olympics by becoming the the first amputee to run against able-bodied athletes. Pistorius used specially designed carbon fibre blades attached to his upper legs. Parole in South Africa requires a process of restorative justice giving the victims of a crime an opportunity to reconcile with the perpetrator or receive an apology. Pistorius was initially found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to five year in jail. The State appealed the verdict and the sentence. In 2015, and Pistorius was found guilty of murder and the longer sentence was passed.
