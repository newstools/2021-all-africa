Previously in Benin, abortion was legal only in cases of rape or incest, if the mother's life was at risk, or if the unborn child had a particularly serious medical condition. Health Minister Benjamin Hounkpatin was quoted by the media as saying that 20% of maternal death complications were as a result of abortion, with more than 200 women dying annually from abortion-related complications. Now under the new law, women will be at liberty to terminate their pregnancy within the first three months if it is likely to "aggravate or cause material, educational, professional or moral distress, and be incompatible with her or the unborn child's interest.           Religious group, The Episcopal Conference of Benin, has said that "abortion not only destroys the life of the foetus but also that of the mother, in many aspects". The group added that "honest and reliable alternatives exist".
