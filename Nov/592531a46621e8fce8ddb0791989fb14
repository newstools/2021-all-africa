As Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam faces water shortage, environmental and hygiene experts have proposed measures to take for people to protect themselves from outbreaks of diseases.           Experts warn that some may take advantage of the water rationing to sell water from unsafe sources after Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (Dawasa) announced that there will be a shortage in the Upper Ruvu and Wami River caused by drought.             For the past three weeks residents report that they have witnessed acute shortage of water with some days passing by without running water.
