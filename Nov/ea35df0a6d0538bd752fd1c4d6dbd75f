A ban on the dumping of electronic waste in the region has received a boost after the East African Community (EAC) prohibited the importing of cathode rays tubes (CRTs) and desktop computer monitors with effect from July 1, 2022. The decision follows concerns that firms in developed countries were exporting these items to developing countries, purportedly as refurbished and good for use, while instead were dumping them so that they don't have to deal with the e-waste when they become obsolete. Many African countries have non-existent or unsafe recycling practices, which is posing threat to the environment and people's health. Once dumped in landfills, the lead-filled CRT glass leachate seeps into the soil and groundwater, and, when broken down, the lead dust particles pollute the air. The ban of these products by the EAC will result in national legislations that will effectively curtail imports of such electronic waste from the West. Most e-waste in Africa comes from Australia, China, the EU, Japan, North America, South Korea, the U.S. and Canada, writes Luke Anami for The East Africa.
