The government has announced a radical plan aimed at supporting an ongoing Covid-19 vaccination campaign, threatening to withhold key services from citizens who fail to take vaccines. Those who fail to take vaccines will be denied access to public transport and hotels beginning December 21, according to the health cabinet secretary. Kagwe further announced that the government will also withhold key services including those offered by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) among other agencies. The CS said the move is aimed at protecting government workers and service providers in other sectors. The government aims to vaccinate at least 10 million people by the end of 2021, writes Capital FM's Njoki Kihiu.
