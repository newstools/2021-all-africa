Somalia's government has declared a state of emergency in the country following a report submitted by a committee set up to evaluate the drought situation in the country. In a statement, Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble called on the Somali people, clerics, businesses and the international community to come to the aid of those affected.           The UN earlier warned in a joint statement on Friday that a rapidly worsening drought could lead to an "extreme situation" by April 2022. So far nearly 100,000 people, especially in central and southern areas, have abandoned their homes in search of food, water and pasture for their livestock. The lack of access to safe water and sanitation has also heightened the risk of water-borne diseases.
