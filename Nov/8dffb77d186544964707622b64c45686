Human rights groups have welcomed the unanimous decision by five judges of the Botswana Court of Appeal, to uphold the June 2019 landmark decision which recognises homosexuality. The groups said that the ruling opens the door to challenge other discriminatory laws in Botswana. The government wanted the 2019 court ruling overturned, arguing that the majority of people in the country did not agree with it. Thato Moruti, the chief executive of the gay rights group, Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals of Botswana (LEGABIBO), said that the ruling "will add impetus to advocacy on human rights issues". Under the previous law, those caught engaging in same-sex activities faced up to seven years imprisonment.
