While significant progress has been made in containing the spread of Covid-19 infections - the country should not take its foot off the pedal, says Deputy President David Mabuza. "The battle is not over. We are not out of the woods yet. We dare not let our guard down as the fourth wave of the pandemic potentially looms large on the horizon," Mabuza said. Mabuza stressed that the country should not lose momentum in the fight against HIV and AIDS and must ensure that all HIV and AIDS programmes are embedded in an overall response to the Covid-19 pandemic. "Covid-19 will remain with us for the foreseeable future, and therefore it's critical to integrate our delivery systems and platforms in such a way that the fight against HIV and AIDS continues to receive our attention within the broader context of our Covid-19 response. We need to continue directing our resources to the fight against HIV and AIDS," Mabuza said. As of November 17, 2021, 2,926,348 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in the country of which 89,504 proved fatal and 2,820,030 resulted in recovery.
