The government has placed great emphasis on palm tree block farming in councils with vast and productive lands as it wants to address edible oil shortages in the country. Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Hussein Bashe said the government has intensified production of palm trees, to halt the import of edible oil. He said that the government is working closely with authorities in Kagera, Tanga, Coast, Katavi and Mbeya regions, to mobilise the public to engage in palm tree cultivation, as they have arable land for the crop. Prime Minister, Kassim Majaliwa has said annually the government spends over U.S.$1.7 million to import cooking oil. In 2019, the government set aside U.S.$4.3 million to boost cultivation of palm oil as part of its strategy to end importation of edible oil. A number of strategies have been put in place to enhance more production of palm oil. The government has promised to help the farmers with palm oil seeds, which has become a priority in the agricultural sector. Farmers have been cultivating the crop early from the 1920s as it continues to gain popularity.
