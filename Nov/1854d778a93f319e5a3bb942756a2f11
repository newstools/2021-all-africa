The Ministry of Interior has released the names and photos of 122 inmates who escaped from the Abolongo Custodial Centre in Oyo State, after a group of gunmen attacked the facility on October 22, 2021.  The Oyo jailbreak follows a similar attack in April 2021 when more than 1,800 inmates were freed in an attack on a facility in Imo state. According to the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, as of Sunday, October 24, 2021, 446 out of 907 escapees had been recaptured. Aregbesola, who visited the facility after the incident had said that the fleeing inmates have nowhere to hide because the service has an updated database of the escapees including their biometrics.
