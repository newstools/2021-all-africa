Sudan's security forces fired tear gas at protesting teachers on Sunday as a two-day nationwide civil disobedience campaign demanding civilian rule began. Civil society groups had called the protest in response to the October takeover of power by the military, rejecting internationally backed efforts for talks with the military over a power-sharing arrangement. The developments unfolded as efforts to resolve the political crisis reached a standstill. The Sudanese Professionals' Association, the union which led the 2019 uprising against longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir, called on protesters to man barricades to prepare for strikes. On October 25, the Sudanese military seized power by dissolving the transitional government and arresting Cabinet ministers. The coup was led by the same man who deposed al-Bashir in 2019, General Abdel-Fattah Burhan. The United Nations and the African Union, as well as world powers, have come out against the military takeover and urged a return to civilian rule.
