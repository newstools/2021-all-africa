Six African sides have already booked their spots in the playoff round of the 2022 Fifa World Cup. Senegal's Lions of Teranga and the Atlas Lions of Morocco lead the way after their opening four fixtures, booking their places for the March 2022 playoffs during the October international break.  Now, Egypt, Ghana, Mali, and the DR Congo have joined them. The Pharaohs just needed to avoid defeat away in Angola to get over the line, while Uganda's draw with Kenya was enough to take Mali through with a victory over Rwanda.  The DR Congo have turned qualification around with two impressive final victories - dealt with rivals Tanzania and Benin home and away to progress, while Ghana ousted South Africa's Bafana Bafana.
