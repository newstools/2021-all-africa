The World Health Organization (WHO) has reaffirmed its commitment to support the country in eradicating Tuberculosis (TB), one of the top infectious killer diseases in the world. Data released by 'Stop TB Partnership' in March 2021 has shown that global treatment and diagnosis of TB cases witnessed a drastic decline in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic which has infected millions of people worldwide. This necessitates a continuous strategic intervention by the federal government, the WHO and other partners, to reduce the burden of the disease in the country by 2030. TB is a contagious disease that is caused by a bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that often affects the lungs. Nigeria remains one of the 30 countries globally with the highest burden of TB.
