National power utility Eskom has said that dwindling diesel supplies for its open cycle gas turbine (OCGT) generators are the cause of week-long loadshedding power cuts across the country. According to the data portal on Eskom's website, the OCGTs are the last resort before load shedding is triggered. "When there is a high demand for electricity and not enough supply of electricity, the system operator starts up expensive diesel generators [OCGT] to balance the grid and keep it stable," it says. 2021 marks the 14th year of load shedding in the country. Power cuts hit the country for the first time in 2007, disrupting businesses, throwing the economy into a tailspin, and testing the patience of households.
