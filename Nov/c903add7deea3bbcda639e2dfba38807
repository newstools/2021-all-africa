At a superficial level the Ethiopian conflict is between a pan-Ethiopianist political centre advocating for a more unitarian state and ethno-nationalist forces fighting for a federal order. This follows a familiar fault line in modern Ethiopian politics.           For the time being the main objective is to defeat Abiy's government. The other is to liberate what they consider as Amhara-occupied territories in western Tigray, and to establish a national transitional government. But Tigray's political future remains very much in the balance, writes Tobias Hagmann for The Conversation.
