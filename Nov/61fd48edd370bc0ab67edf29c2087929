Education Principal Secretary Julius Jwan has reportedly ordered school boards to hold crisis meetings to find ways of ending school fires as cases intensify. Jwan has stated that the government is concerned over the increasing cases of unrest and arson attacks in a number of secondary schools in the country. An estimated 35 schools across the country have reportedly been set alight  in the last month, forcing many to shut down. Authorities say the fires are being set by learners, and have warned that those found committing acts of arson will be locked out of the education system. On November 9, 2021 six learners were arrested, following the burning of a high school in Nyeri county, in western Kenya. A total of 11 were arraigned in court on charges of attempted arson. More than 11 public boarding schools in various parts of the country have reportedly been closed indefinitely after fire targetting dormitories. At least 20 learners were hurt in Buru Buru Girls High School in Nairobi. Officials are blaming drug abuse, stress, curriculum overload and poor learner-teacher relations for the unrest.
