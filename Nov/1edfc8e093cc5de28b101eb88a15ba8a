In a social media post shared on November 22, 2021, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said: "It's time to lead the country through sacrifice. I will join the front to lead the defense forces."           In his message addressing the people of Ethiopia, Abiy vowed to fend off 'internal and external enemies' who he accused of attempting to build their strength on Ethiopia's weakness.           He called on Ethiopians who aspire to be remembered in history to rise up for the country. Abiy also said the struggle was of all black people. The campaign against Ethiopia is a conspiracy to undermine the history, culture, identity and dignity of black people and humiliate them by subduing their symbol of freedom, the post said.
