Mandera, the capital of Mandera County in the former North Eastern Province of Kenya, has been reinvaded in Rhamu Dimtu area by locusts from Ethiopia. This comes just a day after Kenya declared itself locust-free. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported increased breeding in areas likely to receive rainfall despite a decline in locust populations, following sustained control operations, reports CapitalFM. The FAO's situation report of October 14, 2021 said that "as vegetation dries out in the breeding areas of northeast Ethiopia, any swarms that form are expected to migrate north through the Ethiopian Highlands to the Red Sea coast of Eritrea and southeast to eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia".
