The federal government through the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has increased the price Nigerians will pay for single phase and three-phase meters by between 30.6% and 32.3% respectively, from November 22, 2021. NERC has said that the prices were not inclusive of the 7.5% VAT which the electricity distribution companies and other meter providers are expected to include at the point of sale, writes Emmanuel Addeh This Day. Some respite for some, as the government said that consumers who received free meters will not be affected by the increase, write Simon Echewofun Sunday, and, Christiana T. Alabi in Daily Trust. Nigeria has been struggling with an unstable electricity supply for years. This has impacted the economy, manufacturing and other sectors. One town has been without power for decades. The government has announced that it plans to have at least 30% of its total electricity supply coming from renewable sources, with a major focus on solar power by 2030. Militant attacks have also left transmitters damaged in cities like Maiduguri in early 2021 and have added to the electricity woes experienced in the country.
