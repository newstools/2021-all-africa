The World Health Organisation (WHO) has spoken out against travel restrictions aimed at African nations following the emergence of the Omicron Covid-19 variant. While investigations continue into the new variant, the WHO recommended that countries take a risk-based and scientific approach and put in place measures which can limit its possible spread. This comes as Dr. Ayoade Olatunbosun-Alakija, an African Union vaccine expert, slammed the decision by western governments to ban African travellers. In a televised interview on BBC, Olatunbosun-Alakija said that the restrictions were objectionable. "Quite frankly, it is unacceptable. These travel bans are based on politics and not in science. It is wrong," she said.
