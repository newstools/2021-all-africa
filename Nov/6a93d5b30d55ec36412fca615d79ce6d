The national defence force has called on former army officers to register and "contribute with their knowledge and experiences in order to thwart the ongoing assault". Tigray forces are advancing towards Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa as the humanitarian crises escalates, while the UN has offered help with starting a dialogue to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who earlier in the week declared a state of emergency.  U.S. Special Envoy Jeffrey Feltman travelled to Addis on Thursday in response to "continued escalation of armed conflict and civil unrest in Amhara, Afar and Tigray", the State Department said.
