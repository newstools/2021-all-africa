Congo Hold-Up, the largest leak from the African continent to date, reveals how the commercial bank BGFIBank has been used to plunder the DR Congo's public funds and natural resources, largely for the enrichment of former president Joseph Kabila's inner circle. Although Kabila's final term as president was set to end in December 2016, he clung to power and delayed elections for two more years. While the eyes of many observers were fixed on the election stalling tactics in capital city Kinshasa, Kabila's brother Francis Selemani who was the managing director of the BGFIBank at the time, purchased numerous luxury homes in the U.S. and South Africa, it appears - at least in part - using funds diverted from the DR Congo government, writes The Sentry in its report, Embezzled Empire.
