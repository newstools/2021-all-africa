A large crowd of demonstrators rallied on November 14, 2021 at Boulevard March 20, a street leading to the premises of the House of People's Representatives in Bardo to protest against the measures taken by President Kais Saied on July 25 and September 22, 2021.           Demonstrators tried to break through the security barriers to reach the parliament, but were prevented by security forces. Spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior Yasser Mosbah told journalists that "a security plan has been put in place to maximise the protection of demonstrators".           Mosbah denied that there were attempts to prevent demonstrators from accessing the square reserved for the rally, saying some people in possession of sharp tools, who were on the outskirts of the square, were arrested.
