Uganda's Culture Affairs Minister Peace Mutuuzo has said that Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) has increased from 0.3%to 52% in Kapchorwa District, and in Karamajo Sub-region during the Covid-19 pandemic. This is ahead of the 16 days of activism campaign against gender-based violence (GBV). Mutuuzo said the Covid-19 rapid gender assessment by the government indicates that 13% of girls and 52% of women aged between 15 and 49 years are being subjected to FGM in the affected districts. The minister also reported other forms of gender-based violence against both girls and women, including sexual violence, child marriage, physical violence, and rape.  In an effort to raise awareness to end violence against women and children, the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development in partnership with the European Union has launched the Sauti 116,  Uganda's child helpline awareness campaign.
