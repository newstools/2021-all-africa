AllAfrica's Silence The Guns series focuses on peacebuilding on the continent. Today we take closer look at  what the road to peace and peacebuilding is for South Sudan, where the conflict officially ended in 2018.      Listen to Margaret Lowilla, programme officer at the Women's International Peace Centre in Juba, who shares the research she's done on women and peacebuilding, as well as the impact that Covid-19 has had on the country's peace process. AllAfrica is grateful to the Carnegie Foundation for supporting our reporting on peacebuilding
