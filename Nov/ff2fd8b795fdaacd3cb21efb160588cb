At the COP26 summit, African countries are pushing for more money to protect against climate change. But even if further financing is pledged, they still face significant hurdles accessing the funds. Vanessa Nakate, a young black Ugandan climate activist called out leaders for the failed promises of past climate summits. She challenges world leaders to show faithfulness, trustworthiness, and honesty. "There have been 25 COPs before this one and every year, leaders come to these climate negotiations with new pledges, commitments and promises. And as each COP comes and goes, emissions continue to rise. This year will be no different, seeing emissions jump in 2021 by the second biggest annual rise in history. So I hope you can understand why many of the activists who are here in Glasgow and millions who could not be here cannot see the success that is being applauded within this halls. We do not have decades to wait for oil, and gas to be phased out," Nakate said. More than 100 world leaders have promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, and countries are being urged to strengthen their carbon-cutting targets by the end of 2022 in a draft agreement published at the summit.
