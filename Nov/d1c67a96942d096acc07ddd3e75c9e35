At least 9% of households of people living with HIV/Aids in Uganda's eastern region lack enough food, according to the findings from the annual report by Uganda Women's Effort to Save Orphans (UWESO). The number of households still struggling to achieve HIV/Aids viral suppression is 225 out of 2,557, due to insufficient food. The report found that 49% of children living with HIV/Aids presented nutritional deficiency as the major cause of their non-adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) treatment. The figures also show that HIV/Aids prevalence is highest among men aged 45-49 years (14%) while that of women in the same age bracket stands at 12.8%. UWESO's Integrated Child and Youth Development activity (ICYD) activity that conducted this research is funded by USAID and aims at ensuring that children and youth, especially the most vulnerable, receive the support and services necessary to lead resilient, healthy, and productive lives.
