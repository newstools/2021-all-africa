There were more cases of extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances in the country in 2021 than any other period in history, The Nation has learnt.           Police have over the years gained the dubious reputation of being a source of insecurity due to their trigger-happy officers. A latest report shows that there were 43 cases of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances in 2021, the worst ever.           Haki Africa, a human rights organisation based in Mombasa, said the coast region leads with the highest number of such cases, at 29. The report shows most of the victims disappeared shortly after being arrested. Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid challenged the government to ratify the international convention against enforced disappearances and adopt laws that would outlaw such activities in Kenya, writes Kalume Kazungu for The Nation.
