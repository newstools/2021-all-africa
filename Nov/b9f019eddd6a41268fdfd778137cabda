The UN Security Council has endorsed an extension of sanctions on Somalia for another year, in spite of calls by Mogadishu that they want to take charge of the country's own security reform. The sanctions have been in place for nearly 30 years, and have been amended by subsequent resolutions.           This means that the UN Security Council will extend further controls on Somalia's arms purchases to control smuggling of weapons, as well as regulating exemptions.           The resolution was drafted by the UK and promised to support Somalia's rebuilding project, including the equipping of security forces and curtailing sources of funds and weapons for militant group Al-Shabaab. It will expand protection to maritime awareness, tighter controls on financial transactions as well as illicit practices, like charcoal selling and the sale of materials used to make home-made explosive devices.           During a tour of the AU Peace and Security Council in Mogadishu, Somalia told the 15-member AU body that it was interested in less foreign forces but more support to elevate their nascent security teams to guard the country as well as other government departments to provide services to the Somali people.
