[13:13, 11/3/2021] Esther: A statement released by the UN Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) says the peacekeepers arrived on November 1, 2021 at M'Poko International Airport, as part of the periodic rotation and deployment of troops in the country and were heading to their base, when they were allegedly fired on by members of the presidential guard.           According to MINUSCA, the blue helmets were part of the Egyptian Constituent Police Unit.           MINUSCA was established by the Security Council in 2014, to provide security, humanitarian, human rights and political support to the country, following years of civil unrest.           Approximately 157 peacekeepers have lost their lives in the line of duty.           In 2013, CAR became engulfed by intercommunal violence led by mainly Christian anti-balaka militia, and a mainly Muslim coalition, known as Séléka.
