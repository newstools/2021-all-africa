Deputy President William Ruto has reportedly laughed off plans by the Jubilee Party to expel more of its leaders. He said the party had already been ruined by the past removal of its key figures and maintained that no amount of effort can revive the outfit. Ruto said it is time those who ruined the party apologised to its more than eight million members. At the same time, Ruto reportedly said he is ready to leave the Jubilee Party, but lawyers are divided on the consequences of his quitting, or his ejection from the ruling party, given his position as deputy president. He is expected to be shown the door though, following his association with the United Democratic Alliance, on whose ticket he plans to contest the presidency in 2022's election. Mwangi Muiruri and Simon Ciuri for The Nation report that, allies of President Uhuru Kenyatta have expressed concern over an emerging trend where Ruto makes scathing attacks against his boss  outside Mt Kenya region while playing the loyal deputy card when campaigning in Kenyatta's backyard. Ruto and the president had a fallout in 2018 when Kenyatta made peace with his long time rival, opposition leader Raila Odinga and 'neglected' Ruto in the process.
