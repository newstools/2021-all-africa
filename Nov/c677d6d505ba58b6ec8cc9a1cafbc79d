Health workers in Cameroon are fighting a cholera outbreak that claimed 13 lives in two major cities since November 1, 2021. The outbreak, which has affected several hundred people, comes as Cameroon prepares to host the African Football Cup of Nations from January 9 to February 6, 2022. The health ministry said several hundred patients were rushed to hospitals in Yaounde and Ekondo-Titi. It is feared that the outbreak may have claimed more lives in villages where there is a lack of health infrastructure. The health ministry said the cholera outbreak may be difficult to contain. Less than 30% of the population visits hospitals, either because of ignorance or because some civilians prefer traditional African medicine. Health workers are urging civilians to refer suspected cholera cases to the nearest hospitals.
