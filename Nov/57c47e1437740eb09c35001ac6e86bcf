As East Africa's leading carriers Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways grapple with financial crises, regional carriers Air Tanzania, Uganda Airlines and RwandAir have laid out plans to battle for the skies with them. During the just concluded 2021 Dubai Air Show, Uganda Airlines and Air Tanzania signed aircraft and spare parts supply deals with leading manufacturers Airbus and Boeing to ensure seamless services in the region and beyond. In the meantime, RwandAir has signed a codeshare agreement with Qatar Airways that allows the Kigali-based airline to use the Qatari carrier's huge network to bring competition right to the doorsteps of ET and KQ. The falling fortunes of Kenya Airways and Ethiopian Airlines come amid a financial squeeze, which has seen KQ survive on government bailout, while ET has lately gone into an austerity regime.
