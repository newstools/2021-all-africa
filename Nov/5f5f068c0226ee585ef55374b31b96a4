Countries of the global South who are already facing the worst impacts of the climate emergency have expressed their deep dissapointment over how the talks have unfolded. Guinea, who respresented the developing-nation group has expressed "extreme disappointment" at the decision to initiate only an annual "dialogue" to talk about "arrangements for the funding of activities to avert, minimise and address loss and damage". This after United States, the European Union and some other rich nations, were opposed to the establishment of a dedicated new damages fund for vulnerable nations.
