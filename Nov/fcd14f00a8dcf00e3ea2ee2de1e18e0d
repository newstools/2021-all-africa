U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that President Joe Biden intends hosting an Africa leaders' summit, "to drive high-level diplomacy and engagement that can make effective cooperation possible."           Blinken made the announcement at the ECOWAS headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria's legislative capital. This was Blinken's second stop since he began his three-nation Africa tour that saw him also visit Kenya and Senegal.           Blinken said that the U.S. sees African countries as equal partners, as it seeks to bolster its influence on a continent that receives much of its foreign aid from U.S. rival, China.           "The United States firmly believes that it's time to stop treating Africa as a subject of geo-politics and start treating it as the major geo-political player it has become," Blinken said as he outlined the Biden administration's policy toward Africa.
