The government has described the report of the nine-member Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution that was set up to investigate cases of police brutality and the Incident at Lekki Toll Gate, as a rehash of the unverified fake news that has played out on social media since the incident of October 20, 2020.  The protesters were demanding an end to police brutality. At least 11 unarmed people were killed by authorities. Minister of information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, described the report as a sham, arguing that the numerous errors, inconsistencies, discrepancies and omissions had rendered it "a fable". Meanwhile Amnesty International's Nigeria director Osai Ojigho, has expressed misgivings over the government's reaction to the Lagos #EndSARS probe panel report, saying they were not surprised by the government's denial of the Lekki Tollgate incident.  In November 2021, the Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution reported that the Nigerian security forces opened fire on young people who were protesting peacefully against alleged police brutality. The manner of assault and killing could in context be described as a massacre, the report said. President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the federal government will wait for pronouncements from state governments which set up the probe panels before deciding what action to take.
