Almost 60% of wildlife corridors along the Tanzania-Kenya borderland have disappeared. A study by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has made the findings after conducting a study on the Southern Kenya-Northern Tanzania (SOKNOT) Integrated Trans-boundary Wildlife Corridor. The loss of key areas of habitat connecting wildlife populations is attributed to human encroachments and human related activities. The WWF has said the disappearance of the wildlife corridor has contributed to the increase in human wildlife conflicts which has led to deaths, as well as the destruction of crops.
