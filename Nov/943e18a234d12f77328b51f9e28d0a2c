The government has renewed its push to have journalists accredited by the Uganda Media Council if they want to attend public events. "The purpose of registration is to among others, comply with the law; facilitate the authentication of the media practitioners; and to create a database for media practitioners with a view to facilitate and enhance professionalism among the media practitioners," Chris Baryomunsi, Minister of Information, Communication, Technology and National Guidance has said. The High Court in Kampala had earlier quashed, with costs, the directives by the Media Council that required journalists to register to cover the 2021 general election and other State events. Presiding Judge Esta Nambayo declared illegal the registration of journalists by the Media Council without an operational National Institute of Journalists of Uganda to enrol journalists in accordance with the Press and Journalists Act.
