A 2014 government decision to grant oil giant Shell permission to pursue seismic scanning of an area situated over 20km off the Eastern Cape coast has resulted in a cascade of opposition that lasted more than seven years. The latest stand against the oil giant's plan of using high-decibel airguns to map potential oil and natural gas deposits saw environmentalists protest the arrival of the 130m-long seismic blasting vessel, the Amazon Warrior, at Cape Town Harbour. While Shell claims to be operating within the bounds of the law, due to its stakeholder consultation process as part of the Environmental Management Programme during 2013 and passing an Environmental Compliance audit, a case can be made that a '"loophole" has been exploited by the petroleum corporation.
