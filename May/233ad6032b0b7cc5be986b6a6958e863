The death of Her Majesty Queen Shiyiwe Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu has left South Africa in shock and comes a little over a month after that of her husband, King Goodwill Zwelithini. For more than two centuries since the inception of the Zulu kingdom, the kind of acrimony, bitter fallouts, backbiting and backstabbing that played out in the public glare would only have been whispered about among a select few within the royal sanctum, writes Cyril Madlala for Daily Maverick. While the burial and the special official provincial funeral for the late regent of the Zulu nation will take place over the next few days, it will do little to dampen the royal tiffs about succession and the division of the late king and queen's estate.
