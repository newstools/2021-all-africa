The G7 group of countries, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and the U.S. has pledged U.S.$389 million to assist millions of people affected by Boko Haram insurgency in north-eastern Nigeria. The British High Commissioner in Nigeria, Catriona Laing said: " the G7 agreed to support the UN to more than double its plans to tackle drought, epidemics, and other catastrophes before they strike." In March 2021, the UN launched an appeal fund for U.S.$1 billion to help more than eight million vulnerable people in Nigeria. The Boko Haram insurgency has killed approximately 36,000 people and displaced about two million people in Nigeria since 2009.
