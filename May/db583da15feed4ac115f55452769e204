The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the doses are needed in the next six weeks as second doses to all who received the first dose. This is to ensure the follow-up treatments are administered within the recommended 8-12 week interval following the initial jab. A single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine gives around 70% protection for at least 12 weeks. Data on the protection from one dose after 12 weeks is limited, however, Covid-19 antibodies have been found in the body up to 6 months after one dose. The full course provided with a 12-week interval gives 81% protection for an extended period.           In addition to this urgent need, another 200 million doses of any WHO Emergency Use Listed Covid-19 vaccine are needed so that the continent can vaccinate 10% of its population by September 2021.           The global health body's statement comes as the continent recorded 4,785,983 confirmed cases of Covid-19 as of May 27, 2021. Recoveries to date total 4,329,813 while 129,266 deaths have been confirmed and 22,152,109 vaccinations have been administered.
