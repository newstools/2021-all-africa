Six years into President Muhammadu Buhari's term in office, trust in his administration appears to be in decline. It has been worsened by the negative economic impact of Covid-19, an increase in insecurity, banditry, kidnapping for ransom, and civil unrest. Buhari came to power in 2015 with a pledge to fight insecurity in the north-east, in which thousands of people have died and more than two million have been displaced in attacks by militant groups Boko Haram and ISWAP. Six years later, things are getting worse. Boko Haram is expanding its enclaves in the north-west of the country, while banditry, kidnappings, and communal clashes are on the rise. Criminal gangs that have terrorised the population for years have engaged in mass abductions of schoolchildren and students, provoking international outrage. Recently, Buhari asked the U.S. to support Africa's efforts in tackling growing insecurity. Insecurity is pushing Nigeria towards the brink of collapse, with many calling for the resignation of the president for "failing" to secure the country. The crash in oil prices and rising debt is worrying economic experts, who have criticized the government's borrowing as the country's debt is at  U.S.$80 billion.  Nigeria is yet to see a recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and the slump in the oil price, a commodity on which the country's economy rests. However, Presidential spokesman Femi Adesina said Nigeria has become a better country than it was before Buhari's election in 2015. He said: "From infrastructure to finance, education, healthcare, sports, anti-corruption, human development, housing, oil and gas, foreign relations, and many others, the Buhari administration is making giant strides, enough to make Nigerians proud".
