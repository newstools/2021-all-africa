A historic drought, sandstorms caused by deforestation and the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have plunged southern Madagascar into the region's worst nutrition crisis in decades. Some 74,000 children are acutely malnourished. It is estimated that more than a million people face hunger in the country's worst drought in 40 years. An immediate and massive increase in food aid is urgently needed for  the region, says Médecins Sans Frontières.
