President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the establishment of the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) which will be based at the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA). Retired Major-General AM Dikko will be the pioneer coordinator of the centre. According to an ONSA official, the impact of the proliferation of small and light weapons (SALW) across national borders in Africa and the Sahel region had resulted in terrorism, human trafficking, organised crime, and insurrections in West Africa and Nigeria.
