Malawi President Lazarus Chakwera has warned that his country's leading foreign exchange earner, tobacco,was in terminal decline and urged a switch to high-growth crops like cannabis, which was legalised locally for some uses last year. Chakwera made the comments during a state of the nation address in which he said tobacco was expected to earn less than U.S.$200 million in 2021, a figure roughly similar to the past two years but well below previous annual earnings that used to top U.S.$350 million. Countries around the world are either legalising or relaxing laws on cannabis, including several in southern Africa such as Zambia, Lesotho and Zimbabwe.
