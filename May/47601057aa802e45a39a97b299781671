Zimbabwe has detected the first cases of the new Covid-19 variant that emerged in India, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga has, adding that all travelers from the Asian country would be required to undergo mandatory quarantine. Chiwenga, who also doubles as Zimbabwe's health minister, said in a statement the cases had been detected among a group of people in the central town of Kwekwe after a student returned from India on April 29. Zimbabwe has been doing quite well compared to others in the region in vaccinating its people against Covid-19. So far, more than 600,000 have received their first dose, but coverage of the crisis caused by the coronavirus variant in India will likely prompt fears of a third wave.
