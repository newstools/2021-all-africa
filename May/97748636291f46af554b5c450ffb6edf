The Pietermaritzburg High Court has heard that former president Jacob Zuma would be making an application for lead state prosecutor Billy Downer to be removed from his corruption trial, almost 20 years in the making, writes Des Erasmus for the Daily Maverick. This is not the first time Zuma has raised the issue of Downer's prosecutorial fitness for the case, having previously accused the veteran prosecutor of being "hell-bent" on prosecuting him.           Zuma's request comes as the court rescheduled his case to May 26 after legal teams met in the chambers of Judge Piet Koen to deliberate on an appropriate date for postponement. Zuma is accused of receiving 791 payments, totaling R4.1-million, between 1995 and 2004 from his former financial advisor/economic advisor Schabir Shaik and Shaik's companies to help French arms manufacturer Thales, accused number two, secure lucrative defence contracts from the government, as part of the country's multi-billion rand 1999 armaments deal.
