President Muhammadu Buhari is in the eye of a storm as criticism swells around him over the level of insecurity under his watch as Nigeria's leader. Security challenges have sparked anger and calls for Buhari to step down or be removed from office. Nigeria's secret police say they have uncovered a plot to remove the president from office. According to the investigators, disgruntled politicians and religious leaders are behind it. However, the Nigerian army has expressed its support for Buhari, vowing that the military will uphold the country's democracy and warned against plots to overthrow the government.  Buhari came to power in 2015 with a pledge to fight insecurity in the northeast, in which 6,000 people have died and more than two million have been displaced. But six years later, things are getting worse. Boko Haram is expanding its enclaves in the northwest of the country, while banditry, kidnappings and communal clashes are on the rise. Criminal gangs that have terrorized the population for years have engaged in mass abductions of schoolchildren and students, provoking international outrage. Recently, Buhari asked the U.S. to support Africa's efforts in tackling growing insecurity in the region.
