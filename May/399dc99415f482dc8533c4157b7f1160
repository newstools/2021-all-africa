Zimbabwe is considering mass killing of elephants for the first time since 1988 in a bid to reduce the 100,000 strong population of the animals and protect the environment. The proposed culling, along with a plan to sell 500 elephants to professional hunters, is part of the country's efforts to depopulate its national parks, Environment minister Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu said. Zimbabwe has over the years come under attack from animal rights groups over its decision to sell baby elephants to Chinese zoos, and the proposal to cull the animals is likely to be met with fierce resistance.
