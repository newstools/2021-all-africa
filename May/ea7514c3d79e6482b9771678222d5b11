South African health minister Zweli Mkhize's family may have benefited from proceeds of a U.S.$ 10.9 million (R150 million) tender his department awarded to his close associates, the Sunday Times reports. Digital Vibes, the communications company at the centre of the scandal, was run by Mkhize's associates Tahera Mather and Naadhira Mitha, who both worked on his 2017 ANC presidential campaign. Questions are being raised about Mkhize's signature on contracts, which were flagged as irregular by an independent probe. Mkhize has denied personally benefiting from the contract, and denied a friendship with Mather.           On May 28, 2021, the Daily Maverick reported that Digital Vibes paid for maintenance work on a Johannesburg home owned by the Mkhize family. The report also said that the company made payments to a company owned by Mkhize's son, Dedani.
