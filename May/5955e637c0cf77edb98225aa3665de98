A majority of Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives, led by Rep. Jan Schakowsky from Chicago, are asking President Biden for an TRIPS patent waiver to allow other countries, many in poor regions of the world, to manufacture the Covid-19 vaccines that have been created by pharmaceutical companies funded by U.S. taxpayers. "Our goal is straightforward - to speed up the pace of global vaccinations, help the global economy reopen, promote vaccine justice, and increase preparedness for the next pandemic," the lawmakers stated. African leaders and a broad coalition that includes former world leaders, Nobel Prize-winning economists and hundreds of civil society groups advocate the waiver as a necessary step toward ending monopoly control over vaccine production and boosting manufacturing to meet global need.
