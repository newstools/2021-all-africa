France's President Emmanuel Macron's one-day state visit to Rwanda on May 27, 2021 to commemorate the victims of the 1994 genocide is a step towards normalising relations between the two countries after a quarter century of tension, Radio France Internationale reports. Macron is the first French leader since 2010 to visit Rwanda, which has long accused France of being complicit in the mass killings of 800,000 Rwandan Tutsis between April and July 1994. In March, the French government accepted the conclusions of a commission of historians, which accused France of being "blind" to the Hutu regime's preparation of the massacres. The report said that France bore "serious and overwhelming" responsibility for the genocide. On a visit to France in May 2021, Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who led the Tutsi rebellion that ended the genocide, said the report had paved the way for the two countries to have "a good relationship".           Local publication New Times reports that Macron will visit the Kigali Genocide Memorial to pay tribute to the victims of the genocide and will inaugurate the French Cultural Centre. It is thought that the French President will appoint a future French ambassador to Rwanda, New Times reports.
