Since October 2017, the northern province of Mozambique, Cabo Delgado has been suffering violent attacks from an armed group. Over 2020, these attacks grew in strength and brutality - leaving a tremendous psychological impact on communities. The attacks in Palma are illustrative of the violence that the people have been exposed to during the conflict in Cabo Delgado, which has been increasing in intensity and spread over the last year. While they have expanded their capacity over the last months, MSF says their presence is still limited and only addresses a fraction of the needs.
