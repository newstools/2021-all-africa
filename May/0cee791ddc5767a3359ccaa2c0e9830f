South Africa has released a new set of guidelines for handling intimate scenes in film and television shoots. The protocols were compiled in consultation with the country's major bodies for industry workers and producers. They provide guidance on how to make cast and crew safe, especially from sexual harassment and assault says Kate Lush, a co-creator of the new protocols who explains why they matter. The rules were set after revelations of sexual abuse by Hollywood producers that led to the #MeToo movement. In South Africa, in 2017, the organization Sisters Working in Film and Television conducted and published a survey on sexual discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual assault and violence in the South African film and TV industry. They followed this by creating the #ThatsNotOK campaign. "By following the protocols, producers and directors are encouraged to look at intimate content in a professional way. The protocols outline what considerations need to be put in place from pre-production, during production, and into post-production. They talk about consent and agreements that must be put in place. About the right environment to hold auditions and what is the safest way to navigate scenes with intimacy, kissing, nudity, and simulated sex," Lush said.
