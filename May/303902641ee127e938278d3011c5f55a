Zimbabwe's High Court has ruled that President Emmerson Mnangagwa's controversial extension of tenure of the country's top judge is illegal. This comes after Mnangagwa announced that he had extended Luke Malaba's term of office by five years, just hours before the Chief Justice was to due to retire, in a move seen as aimed at consolidating the president's power. However, the court ruled that "Malaba ceased being a judge and Chief Justice of Zimbabwe at 0000hrs on May 15 2021." Malaba has been accused of favouring Mnangagwa's administration since he dismissed opposition leader Nelson Chamisa's presidential election petition following the 2018 vote. The Judicial Service Commission has announced Justice Elizabeth Gwaunza as Acting Chief Justice of Zimbabwe.
