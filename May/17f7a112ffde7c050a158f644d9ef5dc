Businesses that incur financial losses due to power blackouts will receive compensation from Kenya Power if proposed regulations by the energy regulator are adopted. The draft electricity supply regulations seek to compel the power utility to compensate consumers for financial losses, equipment damage, physical injuries and death due to power outages. Currently, Kenya Power offers compensation for injuries and damaged kits, but does not compensate domestic and business customers for financial loss resulting from being left without electricity.
