An unconfirmed number of learners have been taken from the Salihu Tanko Islamic School in Tegina in Niger State, with one person dead. The school consists of nursery and primary schools. Eleven children who were too small and couldn't walk, were released by the armed group. Armed groups carrying out kidnapping for ransom have been blamed for a series of raids on schools and universities in northern Nigeria in recent months, abducting more than 700 students for ransom since December 2020. In Kaduna State, kidnappers have released the remaining 14 students who had been held captive after being abducted last month from Greenfield University.
