Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan has arrived in Kenya for talks with President Uhuru Kenyatta, in her first state visit to Kenya. Suluhu took the reins on the sudden death of John Magufuli on March 17, 2021. Suluhu's visit, the second outside her country since taking office on March 19, follows a similar visit to Uganda where she signed a petroleum pipeline deal with President Yoweri Museveni. Her visit has reportedly brought about hope for the further deepening of regional integration, that will benefit the East African Community member states.
