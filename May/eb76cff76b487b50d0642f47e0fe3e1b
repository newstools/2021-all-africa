Ethiopians were scheduled to cast their votes to elect a new Parliament as well as regional and municipal councils on June 5, 2021. This is the second time the elections have been postponed after the Covid-19 pandemic delayed the August 2020 vote. That delay lead to an unsanctioned election by the local administration in Tigray in defiance of the federal government decision, which led to the current war. William Davison of the International Crisis Group told Deutsche Welle that a peaceful election seems increasingly unlikely while unresolved grievances persist among nationalities and ethnic groups. "The big problem is the level of violence we're seeing across the country at this time, which looks like it is increasing in the run-up to the elections in early June," Davidson said. Meanwhile the United States says it is gravely concerned by the increasing number of cases of military forces blocking humanitarian access to parts of the Tigray region, which places the 5.2 million people in the region in immediate need of assistance at even greater risk. The U.S. also called on Eritrea to immediately withdraw it forces, which have been accused of numerous atrocities again the civilian Tigray population.
