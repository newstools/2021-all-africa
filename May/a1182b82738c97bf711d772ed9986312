French prosecutors have reportedly asked judges to drop a case accusing senior members of the French armed forces of complicity in the massacre of Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The call to drop the 15-year-old case follows the recent publication of a report on France's role in the genocide. The case against the French army was taken by survivors of the 1994 massacre in the hills of Bisesero, in western Rwanda. They accused French troops of deliberately abandoning them to Hutu extremists who, within days, murdered hundreds of people in the area.
