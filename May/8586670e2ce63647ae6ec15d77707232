Funds totalling £4,214,017.66 (U.S.$5.9 million) looted by James Ibori, a former Delta State governor, and some of his associates, that was found in various banking institutions in the UK, has finally been repatriated back to Nigeria, according to Justice Minister Abubakar Malami. Now the wrangling over who should get the funds is beginning to heat up again with Delta State government saying that since the funds were looted from its coffers it should be returned there. The federal government already earmarked the funds for the completion of the Second Niger Bridge, Abuja-Kano Expressway and the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. These projects are all outside of Delta State.
