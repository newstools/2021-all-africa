Transgender women will for the first time be able to compete, a move that has earned widespread praise. However, in order to be eligible to compete internationally, the contestant must be in possession of a valid South African ID document reflecting that their amended sex is female. The competition itself was previously hailed for breaking beauty stereotypes by crowning Zozibini Tunzi - a short-haired woman with a darker complexion - as the 2019 winner. Tunzi went on to make history when she became the first Miss Universe wearing a short, natural haircut, a move that was applauded by many black people around the world.
