Nigerians are in shock after legendary Nigerian Afrobeat pioneer, Fela Kuti, lost out in the race to become an inductee of the 2021 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The news came as a surprise for Fela's fans because he placed second in the fan vote category on the last day of voting. Fela's son Femi Kuti, bemoaned the lack of transparency in the selection process, saying the board had "wasted the voters' time". Explaining the rationale behind the choice of inductees on their website, the organisers said ballots were sent to an international voting body of more than 1,200 artists, including current living Inductees, historians, and members of the music industry. The 2021 inductees are Tina Turner, Carole King, The Go-Go's, JAY-Z, Foo Fighters, and Todd Rundgren. If Fela Kuti had won, he would have made history as the first Nigerian artist to be inducted. Through his music and human rights activism, Fela campaigned against military rule and corruption in Nigeria. He died on August 2, 1997, at the age of 59.
