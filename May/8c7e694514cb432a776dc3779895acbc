Health experts have warned that the government's Covid-19 strategy could fall apart and end up like India's situation. The ministry of health's efforts are reportedly random, haphazard and reactionary without accurate data and planning. The government has been urged to publish accurate data and explain what should be done to bend the curve. However, the government has deployed rapid testing kits at the points of entry and will enhance surveillance to detect new virulent variants or strains of Covid-19. Flights from India and the UK have been stopped and the government has also expanded the list of countries whose travelers must undergo 14-day mandatory quarantine upon arrival. All arrivals are supposed to fill in the Covid-19 health surveillance form available online. As of May 18, 2021, Kenya has recorded 165,537 Covid-19 cases, 113,87 recoveries, 3,013 deaths and 933,436 vaccinations.
