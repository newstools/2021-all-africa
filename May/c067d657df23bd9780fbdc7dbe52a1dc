A new report has exposed the behaviour of Department of Home Affairs administrators who misapply the law and use bigoted language against gender-diverse applicants fleeing persecution, write Jan Bornman and Anastasya Eliseeva for New Frame. In LGBTIQ+ Asylum Seekers in South Africa: A Review of Refugee Status Denials Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, the researchers reviewed 67 denial letters written by refugee status determination officers (RSDOs) to 65 asylum seekers who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and/or intersex.           The researchers found that home affairs officials consistently fell short in a number of legal obligations when reviewing the applications of LGBTIQ+ asylum seekers, contravening elements of several pieces of legislation. "By failing to comply with these laws, RSDOs violate applicants' rights as outlined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. We also identify serious misapplications of international law," the report found.
