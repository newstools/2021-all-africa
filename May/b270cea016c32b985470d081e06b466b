Since last year, there have been widespread reports of arrests, abductions and torture in Uganda. Hundreds of people have claimed to have been seized by security forces, while hundreds more may still be unaccounted for. To get a clear view of the situation, Liam Taylor, a freelance journalist based in Kampala, Uganda interviewed dozens of former abductees, the families of missing people and state authorities, all kept anonymous for their own protection. The context for the recent abductions were the 14 January elections, which pit President Yoweri Museveni against popstar-politician Robert Kyagulanyi better known as Bobi Wine. On the campaign trail in November 2020, Wine was detained for two days for allegedly violating COVID-19 restrictions. His arrest sparked protests, especially in the capital Kampala, and the state shot at least 54 people dead. Abductions intensified after this episode, continuing through polling day, which was marred by widespread allegations of fraud, and to Museveni's inauguration in May. These interviews revealed that over a thousand people have been detained, most abductions are in the central region, some arrests appear targeted but many are random, many are taken to prisons or barracks, others are taken to unidentified houses. "We don't know the organisational infrastructure behind the abductions or who knew what and when. We don't know whether detentions were well-planned, or whether they ran out of control as competing security networks jostle for influence. We don't know where are these missing people and when will they come back and we also don't know how many people have been killed," Taylor says it is difficult, however, to get a clear picture of what is happening. The government has repeatedly denied claims or hidden the truth. Meanwhile, opposition supporters' claims are not always verified, especially those shared in the maelstrom of social media.
