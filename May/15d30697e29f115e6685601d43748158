On November 14, 2019 Tanzania's then-foreign affairs minister Palamagamba Kabudi signed a notice of withdrawal from the African Court that was delivered to the African Union Commission chairperson on November 21, 2019. The withdrawal then took effect on November 22,2020 and barred individuals and non-governmental organisations from filing cases against Tanzania at the Arusha-based court. The African Court, which is the AU's apex human rights mechanism, has jurisdiction to hear cases alleging violations of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. Now Tanzania's new Foreign Affairs and EAC Minister Liberata Mulamula said that the country did not withdraw but only wanted its citizens who were aggrieved, to first exhaust the local court processes before proceeding to the African Court.
