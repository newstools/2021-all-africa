President Emmerson Mnangagwa has appointed five judges to the Constitutional Court. The five justices are Paddington Garwe, Rita Makarau, Anne-Mary Goora, Ben Hlatshwayo and Bharat Patel. Before their appointment, the five were all acting judges of the Constitutional Court that who were among the 12 candidates that participated in the public interviews conducted in September 2020. However, Mnangagwa snubbed appointing High Court judge, Justice Happias Zhou who came third in 2020's public interviews for the Constitutional Court bench appointments. Earlier, Justice Zhou ruled Luke Malaba's five-year extension term of office by Mnangagwa as  Chief Justice was invalid. Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi later rebuked Zhou and his bench for doing political bidding for the West and civic society organisations.
