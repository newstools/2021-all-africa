Almost one year after President Évariste Ndayishimiye's inauguration, the authorities have sent contradictory signals, writes Human Righs Watch. While they have lifted some restrictions imposed on civil society and media since the country's 2015 political crisis, they have also doubled down on human rights defenders and journalists who are perceived to be critical of the government.The group says Burundi's scrutiny and control of media and nongovernmental organizations, and the conviction after deeply flawed proceedings of 12 journalists and activists in exile, have a continued chilling effect on their work. Lewis Mudge, Central Africa Director at Human Rights Watch has said that "the government should go beyond symbolic gestures of good faith to address the entrenched system of repression under the late President Pierre Nkurunziza. Substantive reforms are needed to address the lack of judicial independence, politicized prosecutions, and the absence of accountability for abuses committed since 2015."
