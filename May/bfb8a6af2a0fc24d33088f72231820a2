The use of charcoal and firewood in the country leads to the destruction of a total of 19.4 million hectares of forest every year, the government has said. Selemani Jafo, the environmental minister in the vice president's office, said that the government is on course to curb the challenge and maintain the country's ecosystem. This includes embarking on a campaign that will see every local government council plant a minimum of 1.5 million trees annually. Addressing members of the media on the upcoming World Environment Day that is observed  every June 5th, Jafo said the trees have to be sustained for the country to successfully maintain the ecology.
