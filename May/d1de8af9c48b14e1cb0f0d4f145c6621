There are growing fears that earnings from tobacco, which remains touted as the country's second single largest foreign currency earner after gold's net export proceeds, might be far less in foreign receipts compared to other commodities because most of the contract schemes are sponsored using offshore funds. According to the state media, reports say after export, most of the proceeds remain offshore in the hands of funders and the country benefits less since it's just a production platform. The central bank is on record saying the country earns an average U.S.$800 million from tobacco annually, but the huge amounts of money running into billions, is not enjoyed in Zimbabwe.
