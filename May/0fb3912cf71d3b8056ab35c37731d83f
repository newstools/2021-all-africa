"This no longer business as usual, unions are going to be united," said Peter Mutasa, President of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). The situation in Zimbabwe is dire, with basic salaries at or near the poverty line and workers unable to meet basic expenses. The Covid-19 shutdowns have reduced incomes for more than half of all urban workers. According to labour representatives, the government's response has been to collude with business to stifle workers' rights. While Zimbabwe's workers and their families continue fighting for economic and social justice, the government says it is aware of the workers' plight, but does not have the funds to raise salaries above the poverty line.
