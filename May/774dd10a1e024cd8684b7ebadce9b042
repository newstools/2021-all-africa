The government has reintroduced stricter lockdown conditions to further limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Face masks are now mandatory in all government buildings, bars, while nightclubs will remain closed and public gatherings restricted to 50 people. Curfew times will be from 12am to 4am. Most countries in Africa - including Nigeria - have experienced a second wave of the pandemic, with some seeing a third wave due to new more contagious variants. To ensure no imported cases from countries experiencing a surge in Covid-19 cases, Nigeria recently banned travellers from Brazil, India, and Turkey. So far, the virus has infected 165,468 and claimed 2,065 lives since the first case in February 2020, official figures show.
