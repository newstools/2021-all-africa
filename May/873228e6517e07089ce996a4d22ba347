The Israeli security forces have used repeated, unwarranted and excessive force against Palestinian protesters in occupied East Jerusalem Amnesty International has said as it called on the UN Security Council members to convene an open session. The call follows four days of violence in which hundreds of Palestinians were injured. Amnesty is also calling on the Israeli authorities to immediately halt forced evictions in the neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah, and end the ongoing forced displacement of Palestinians from East Jerusalem.  The hostile acts carried out by the Israeli authorities represent a deliberate provocation of Palestinian worshippers and deprive them of the right to perform their religious rites, Egypt's Mufti Shawqi Allam pointed out. Meanwhile, the Namibian government along with South African political parties and civil society organisations say they stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people and called on Israeli forces to end their violent acts against Palestinians.
