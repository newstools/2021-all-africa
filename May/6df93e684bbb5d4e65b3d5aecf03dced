Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a new visa policy during a joint session of Kenya and Tanzanian business community in Nairobi, which was attended by  visiting Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan. The announcement that it has scrapped work visa and permit requirements for Tanzanian nationals is an effort to boost trade and tourism between the two countries. It will also fast-track the implementation of the East African Common Market Protocol to allow workers to move freely in the region. The two presidents committed to eliminate barriers hindering the smooth flow of trade, instructing their respective officials to initiate and conclude trade talks within a fortnight, to fasttrack trade that amounts to U.S.$576 million annually. President Samia welcomed Kenyan traders to invest in Tanzania, saying the neighbouring country is ready and open for business.
