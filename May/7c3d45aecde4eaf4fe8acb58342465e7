President Uhuru Kenyatta has commissioned the opening of the first berth of the new Lamu Port, marking a major milestone for the regional Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor project (LAPSSET) launched in 2012. The commissioning of the port elevates Kenya to a strategic position to wrest the trans-shipment market from Djibouti and South Africa, officials have said. The new port which will mainly handle trans-shipment cargo, comes at a time nearly all the ports in the region are undergoing upgrades to meet growing demand. Lamu port is one of the main components of the LAPSSET project and is expected to complement the port of Mombasa while opening Kenya's largely underdeveloped frontier. Kenya's coastline plays an integral role in the regional economy by providing the artery through which goods are exported to the world.
