Milcah Hadida, a Kenya Red Cross volunteer, was among 25 other health workers and volunteers nominated globally by the Red Crescent Society for the award. Hadida runs a campaign to collect sanitary towels, then rides on a bicycle to distribute them to vulnerable girls in communities around the county. Her five-month efforts have seen her reach 2,300 girls and young women. The Florence Nightingale medal recognises exemplary service or pioneering spirit in the areas of public health and nursing education.
