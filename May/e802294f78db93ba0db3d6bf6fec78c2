In developing economies, many people are excluded in various ways from financial services. Emmanuel Mogaji for The Conversation approached the top managers of five institutions and asked how they create awareness of their products and services among these customers. The study provided a picture of how financial products are being developed, marketed, and delivered to this target market in Nigeria. The findings revealed that banks are using both innovative and traditional strategies and technologies to reach a variety of customers. The bank managers said their strategies were working and previously excluded customers could now access various financial products.
