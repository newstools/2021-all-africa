Political leaders in Somalia have agreed on a framework for long-delayed national elections, hoping to avert a crisis that could push the fragile country into political violence, Voice of America reports. The agreement signed by Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble and the leaders of five regional states laid out a path to parliamentary elections to begin within 60 days. The agreement comes after four days of heated talks in Mogadishu between the prime minister, representing the federal government, the leaders of five federal member regional states and the administration of Mogadishu.           Somalia was scheduled to hold elections last year, but the polls never happened due to complications, political disputes, and continuous security threats by al-Shabab militants. Talks for holding elections between the federal government and regional leaders began in March, but broke down in early April, as the two houses of parliament clashed on the status of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, known popularly as Farmajo.
