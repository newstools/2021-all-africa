Public prosecutors on Tuesday freed four suspects in a case involving a woman who said she was drugged and raped in 2014 at the Fairmont Hotel in the capital, Cairo, as evidence amassed during nearly nine months of investigation was insufficient. Entessar El-Saeed, director of the Cairo Foundation for Development and Law said "The problem is not only with the law, but it is mainly with social attitudes towards women," "There is no doubt that the decision is frustrating, but this does not mean the end of the road. It will not make us surrender to the phenomenon of sexual harassment and violence against women," she said. Socially conservative attitudes in many parts of Egypt mean women are reluctant to report sexual violence and harassment for fear of being judged and blamed, and because they believe they are unlikely to get justice. Several witnesses in the case were arrested on drug and debauchery charges in what some human rights activists said was part of a tendency by authorities to prioritise traditional social morality at the expense of women's rights.
