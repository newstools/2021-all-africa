The ruling African National Congress has suspended its Secretary-General Ace Magashule. This comes after the party elected to suspend members facing serious criminal charges and who refuse to step down. The ANC resolved at its 2017 national conference that any representative (elected or employed) who was criminally charged should step aside. Magasghule faces several corruption-related charges in connection with one of the more contentious contracts the Free State provincial government awarded during his time as premier.
