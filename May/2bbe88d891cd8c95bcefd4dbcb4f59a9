Survivors of traumatic experiences and others in need of support in Sierra Leone are being let down by the severe lack of available mental health facilities, years after the country's brutal civil war and devastating Ebola epidemic, Amnesty International has said in a new report. The report states that mental health services in the country fall far short of meeting people's needs, due to multiple significant barriers. These include a lack of government spending, insufficient donor support, a shortage of skilled mental health professionals, and the few available services being concentrated primarily in cities. Amnesty International is also calling on the government to expedite the process of passing new mental health legislation to replace the discriminatory colonial-era 'Lunacy Act' of 1902, in order to bring national law in line with international human rights obligations.
