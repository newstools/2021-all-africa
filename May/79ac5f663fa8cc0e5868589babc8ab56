A new Premium Times report says delay in the issuance of certified true copies (CTCs) of court judgments has become a big problem in the administration of criminal justice in Nigeria and has led to the denial of justice. The CTC is required by the accused to appeal a judgement within a three months window as stipulated by law. The law also stipulates that they be made available within seven days. But lawyers told Premium Times that they often wait for months to obtain the copies and sometimes miss the three-month deadline to file an appeal. The reports finds that sometimes court officials need "mobilisation" which is an undisclosed amount offered as a tip to speed up the process. A lawyer, Ibrahim Gambari said: "A lot of work is on our judges in and outside the court. So if our courts are digitised, it will lessen the burden of the judges. In fact, our judges of today need more than one legal assistant. If judgment has been typed already, the legal assistant can help with the vetting."
