Malawi lawmakers have taken a sudden U-turn and confirmed Martha Chizuma as the first woman to head Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau. Earlier, MPs had rejected Chizuma for the post, raising accusations that the opposition scuttled the process for fear of being prosecuted for corruption during their time in power. Authorities in Malawi say the confirmation of Chizuma will complement President Chakwera's fight against graft. Chizuma who is a member of the Bar Association of Malawi, the Women Lawyers Association of Malawi and the Women Judges Association of Malawi, has been practising law for 18 years. Previously, Chizuma was legal counsel for Limbe Leaf Tobacco Company. She was also the Deputy Chairperson of Industrial Relations Court, the Assistant Registrar of the High Court and Supreme Court of Appeal and a Senior Resident Magistrate.
