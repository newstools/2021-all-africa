Attacks on civilians and aid workers in South Sudan are rising, according to Human Rights Watch. The watchdog is calling on the UN Security Council to renew its arms embargo which expires on May 31, 2021. The government however argues that lifting the arms embargo will be key to assembling a unified army of former foes, and the army needs to be better-equipped to tackle growing intercommunal violence. The rights group said that over the last year, the UN has repeatedly recorded an increase in violence at the community level in Jonglei and Greater Pibor, Warrap, and northern Bahr el Ghazal states. Here the violence has become more lethal and organised, as political players deliberately fuel underlying grievances and arm communities. This violence has had a devastating impact on civilians, with hundreds killed or maimed and thousands displaced. Civilian property, including health centres and schools, have been attacked and destroyed. Aid workers continue to be attacked and killed - with three already dead in 2021. According to HRW, the country's abusive National Security Service continues to suppress government critics and abuse rights.
