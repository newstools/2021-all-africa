There has been a rising wave of attacks on police stations and police officers in some southern states in Nigeria. At least 127 officers have been killed and 25 stations razed in the past five months. Security experts have warned that the spate of attacks in the country could be a dangerous signal that insurgency is brewing. Political rivalry among some politicians have been accusing each other of sponsoring the attacks. The attacks on police personnel and facilities occur despite Nigeria grappling with several security crises, including a decade-long Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast, banditry in many northern states, as well as kidnappings, and perennial clashes between herders and farmers in several parts of the country. The Conversation Africa's Wale Fatade asked sociologist Lanre Ikuteyijo for his view on why this is happening and how the country can stop the attacks.
