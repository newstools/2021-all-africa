Conflict and peace-building in Africa were on the agenda of United Nations meetings on May 18 and 19, 2021.  Ahead of a UN Security Council meeting on May 19, preparatory discussions focussed on the Sahel. The theme of the full Security Council meeting is "Peace and security in Africa: Addressing root causes of conflict while promoting post-pandemic recovery." Challenges facing the continent also include violent insurgencies in Mozambique, conflict in Ethiopia, economic destruction from the Covid-19 pandemic and more. Senior UN peacekeeping official Jean-Pierre Lacroix told a meeting on Tuesday that regional troops deployed to combat terrorists in the Sahel region had scaled up the tempo of their operations in recent months, efforts that must be matched by a spirit of solidarity among their global partners.  Ahead of the meeting the United States's U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a longtime Africa specialist, laid out the Biden administration's policies on Africa in a briefing for the continent's media. Answering questions from journalists, she emphasized the administration's commitment to working in partnerships with African governments, civil society groups, and citizens in helping to build peace.  She also stressed the importance both of the role of women and of democracy in ending the conflict. The 15-member Security Council currently includes Kenya, Niger, and Tunisia as non-permanent members.
