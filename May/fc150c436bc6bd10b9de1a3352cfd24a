Nigeria is set to become the first country ever to host two consecutive editions of the African Senior Athletics Championship. Algeria had been due to host the event but had asked for a postponement due to the ongoing global Covid-19 pandemic. The biennial event had been delayed three times before Nigeria agreed to host the championships, which should have taken place in 2020 before being postponed by a year due to Covid-19. The championship will run from June 23 to 27, 2021 at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere. Delta State hosted the last edition of the championship in 2018. This will be the second time Lagos will be hosting this Championship having done so 32 years ago in 1989. Nigeria is now tied with Egypt as the two African countries to host the championships three times since the inaugural edition in 1979 in Dakar, Senegal.
