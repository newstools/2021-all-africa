Zimbabwe Police Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga has admitted the country was losing millions of dollars in foreign currency through mineral leakages due to porous national borders and poor security detection equipment at entry and exit points.  He also blamed poor coordination among state security agencies for fuelling the illicit trade. In 2020, Zimbabwe Miners Federation President Henrietta Rushwaya was nabbed at the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport while attempting to smuggle 6kg of gold to Dubai. Meanwhile, in May 2021 a Zimbabwean man, Tashinga Nyasha Masinire, was arrested at the OR Tambo International Airport while in possession of 23 pieces of gold weighing 14kg. He was also en route to Dubai from Harare.
