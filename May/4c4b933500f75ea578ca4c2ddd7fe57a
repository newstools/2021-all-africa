A new digital platform, COVIDHQ Africa, provides young African writers, thought leaders, artists, and activists perspectives on issues related to the global pandemic - where they will be able to speak openly and honestly about the struggles they are facing, as well as the ways in which they are learning to innovate and practice resilience. Driven by the Mastercard Foundation in partnership with Zain Verjee Group, COVIDHQ Africa is a platform through which Africans are documenting and sharing their experiences with COVID-19, vaccination roll outs, and the knock-on effects of lockdowns and restrictions.
