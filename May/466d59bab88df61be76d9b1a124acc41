Just weeks after Namibian President Hage Geingob told the World Health Organization (WHO) that "vaccine apartheid" presented a growing risk of worsening the pandemic across Africa, he and First Lady Monica Geingos - a champion of young people and campaigner against gender-based violence - tested positive for Covid19. WHO Director-General Tedros agreed that the failure of wealthy nations and vaccine manufacturers to provide more "vaccine equity" is both a "moral catastrophe" and short-sighted, because no nation is safe as long as the virus rages in poorer countries. Responding to well wishers after the test results were announced, the president @hagegeingob tweeted: I vainly tried to thank you individually until my finger got tired from typing. @FirstLadyNam and I are holding on well and your outpouring of support for our recovery is truly appreciated. God Bless You.
