White contractors were prioritised for evacuation ahead of Black locals during a rescue operation following an attack in March 2021 by insurgents on the Mozambican town of Palma, according to Amnesty International. In a report compiled from interviews with 11 Black survivors, Amnesty says that even dogs were pulled to safety before Black people by a helicopter that airlifted civilians from a hotel where they had sought refuge. The attack on Palma left dozens of Mozambicans and foreigners dead, according to the government, and displaced tens of thousands. It marked a major intensification in a conflict that has wreaked havoc across Cabo Delgado province for more than three years.
