According to Fatima Hassan and Mitchell Warren, the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed that vaccine development and testing timelines can be shrunk from decades to months. Hassan, the founder and director of the Health Justice Initiative, and Warren, the executive director of the US-based advocacy organisation, AVAC, believe that the way in which the world has responded to Covid-19 has fundamentally changed ideas of what's possible in vaccine development - but access to that scientific knowledge remains the property of drug companies and research institutions in wealthy countries. The pair devised a five-point list that could be used as a basis from which the sped-up vaccine process could be applied to HIV/Aids research, drawing on the lessons learned from the Covid-19 outbreak.
