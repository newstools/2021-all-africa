President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed a strong resolve to address the conflicts of herders and farmers permanently, but not without chiding the Southern Governors' Forum for their recent ban on open grazing, which he described as an act of questionable legality. The president further accused the governors of politicking with serious security issues and an attempt at a show of power. Buhari has approved the rehabilitation of grazing reserves across the country as from June 2021, to curb bloody clashes between herders and farmers across the country. This development comes a few days after southern governors banned open grazing in the entire region. The move was criticized as unconstitutional by the nation's Justice Minister Abubakar Malami
