At least 150 people are missing and feared dead after an overloaded boat capsized in Kebbi State with approximately 180 passengers on board. Most of the passengers are from Kebbi State and are believed to be traders. President Muhammadu Buhari described the accident as "devastating", offering his condolences to the victims' families. At least 20 people have reportedly been rescued, with the authorities blaming the incident on overloading. The capsizing of boats are common on Nigerian waterways and are mostly due to overloading and a lack of maintenance.
