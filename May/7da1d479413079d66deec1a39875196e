In times of conflict, women, girls, and children usually bear the brunt of violence, and Dikwa is one of the communities most affected by the insurgency in the North East of Nigeria. The insecurity and resulting worker attrition have resulted in limited access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive Health and other health services in the area. From a shortage of products and services at the point of need to unfriendly health workers and limited youth centres, girls are unable to access the services they need. This means they tend to look for alternative, sometimes detrimental methods to meet their needs, writes Thelma Chioma Abeku for Nigeria Health Watch.
