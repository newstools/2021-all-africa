Governors of the 17 southern states under the aegis of the Southern Governors Forum have resolved to ban open grazing, the free roaming of animals cared for by herders. Open grazing has often caused conflicts between host communities and migrant herders, leading to several deaths in many states. The governors also called on President Muhammadu Buhari to "convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency, to address address calls by Nigerians for greater inclusiveness in governance." The meeting follows attacks on security officials and facilities in the south-east and south-south regions of the country. Meanwhile, the president has endorsed new security measures to tackle the challenges of insecurity in the south-east and south-south.
