Uganda's longest-serving statesman, President Yoweri Museveni, has been sworn in today, May 12, 2021 for a sixth five-year term. The 76-year-old leader swore to observe the laws of the country and promote the welfare of the people of Uganda. At least 11 African heads of state and leaders of government arrived in Uganda to witness the swearing-in ceremony, including Burundi President Évariste Ndayishimiye, Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa, South Sudan President Salva Kiir, Namibia President Hage Geingob and Guinea President Alpha of Conde. Museveni, who has ruled Uganda since 1986, won a contested January 14, 2021 election with 58% of the votes, while his closest challenger Robert Kyagulanyi, better known as Bobi Wine, garnered 34% - with Wine claiming that the election was rigged. In November 2020, at least 54 people were killed in a protest that erupted after Wine was detained while campaigning. In April 2021 the country's main donor, the United States, announced visa bans on government officials accused of human rights violations and repressive acts.
