Numerous repellent-based products, such as creams, roll-ons and sprays, are available on the market for outdoor protection. Most of these have a very short period of protection - a few hours. People need to be protected from mosquito bites for longer. To address this problem, research by António B. Mapossa, Walter W. Focke, Robert K. Tewo, René Androsch and Taneshka Kruger aims to develop a new, cost-effective product such as an anklet or bracelet to repel mosquitoes for an extended period.           The project is a collaboration between the Institute of Applied Materials and the Institute for Sustainable Malaria Control at the University of Pretoria in South Africa alongside Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany and Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique.
