Tashinga Nyasha Masimire, the 33-year-old man arrested for allegedly attempting to smuggle 23 pieces of gold worth R11 million (U.S.$784,238) into South Africa from Zimbabwe, has been granted bail. Masimire was arrested after landing at OR Tambo International Airport. In 2020, the first family distanced itself from an attempt to smuggle 6kg of gold out of the country. In a statement, First Lady Auxilia Mnangagwa said: "I do not engage in illegal narrow-minded pursuits like gold smuggling." The gold was found in the possession of miners' federation boss, Henrietta Rushwaya. At the time of her arrest, she and co-accused Gift Karanda said the gold belonged to the Zimbabwe first lady, Auxilia Mnangagwa and her son, Collins Mnangagwa. When he came into office, President Emmerson Mnangagwa vowed to tackle corruption but his administration has been accused of shielding the real culprits while using less powerful people as scapegoats.
