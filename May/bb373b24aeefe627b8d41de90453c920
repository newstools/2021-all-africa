Human rights watchdog Amnesty International has accused Nigerian authorities of not doing enough to curb the violence that has claimed thousands of lives. In 2020, Amnesty accused the Nigerian authorities of a cover-up in the Lekki Toll Gate deaths, that occurred during the #EndSARS protests. At least 56 people were killed. The watchdog then called on the government to bring to justice, those behind the shootings and to protect those who were exercising their right to freedom of assembly. The rights group accused the army of having an intention "to kill without consequences". The human rights body says the alarming escalation of attacks, abductions for ransom, and frequent killings across Nigeria have left people feeling more unsafe, showing utter failure on the part of the authorities to protect lives and property.  Osai Ojigho, director of Amnesty International Nigeria says that they are calling on authorities at all levels, "to invest in people's welfare and prioritize access to education, healthcare, and other basic public services".
