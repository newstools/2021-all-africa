President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday pledged that his administration will use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits to ensure that they did not hinder access to farms and food production in the coming growing season.  The president, who expressed hope for a good rainy season this year, said: "Security agencies are working to ensure people can work safely on farms in order to have food surpluses, including for export". Buhari said this while addressing reporters after observing the Eid-il-Fitri prayers at the State House in Abuja. Buhari has been criticized for his handling of the security situation in the country. Security challenges have sparked anger and calls for Buhari to step down or be removed from office. Nigeria has faced a spate of kidnappings and killings, especially of students that have shut down hundreds of schools in the north of the country.
