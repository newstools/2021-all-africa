Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, has confirmed that 87 sites are ready to open their doors to vaccinate the elderly as the country ramps up its biggest inoculation effort. This comes as three of the nation's provinces have entered the third wave of Covid-19 infections. According to Mkhize, government will run 83 of the vaccination sites, while four will be in the private sector. "We need the private sector and they are part of the system." He said his department was hoping to scale up these centres to about 200 by the end of the week. The Minister reiterated government's strategy to immunise citizens who are aged 60 and above in the second phase of the Covid-19 vaccination plan as they are deemed the most vulnerable for becoming ill or dying of Covid-19.           As of May 17, 2021, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country total 1,613,728 of which 55,210 proved fatal and 1,524,352 resulted in recovery while 478,733 vaccinations have been administered.
