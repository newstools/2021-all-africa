The UN agriculture chief has warned that severe underfunding of Africa's agri-food sector has boosted food insecurity and was hampering the future development of countries across the continent. "Let's unblock the bottlenecks that are holding back potential by increasing coordination and upskilling human capacity in African nations", urged Qu Dongyu, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Speaking at the launch of FAO's latest report, Public Expenditure on Food and Agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, he added that funds must also be unlocked and public finance systems streamlined, "so that the scarce resources we have do not go unspent". Based on "rigorous analysis over the last 15 years, made possible thanks to strong collaboration with our Members in the region", the FAO chief explained that the report brings to light a gap between long-standing political commitments and the financial realities facing 13 sub-Saharan countries.
