Somalia has rejected the appointment of former Ghanaian President John Mahama as the African Union's special envoy to help mediate its political impasse. The Nation reports that Mohamed Abdirazak, Somalia's Foreign and International Cooperation Minister, has written to AU Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat in a letter dated May 9, 2021 but circulated among diplomats on May 11, 2021. The letter says the Ghanaian ex-leader is closely associated with the leadership in Kenya and cannot be trusted to be impartial. Somalia severed diplomatic ties with Kenya on December 15, 2020, after alleging its neighbour was meddling in its affairs, but restored relations in early May 2021. Mahama, who ruled Ghana between 2012 and 2017, was named the High Representative of the African Union for Somalia's political mediation on May 8, 2021. An AU statement said he would "work with the Somali stakeholders to reach a mutually acceptable compromise towards an all-encompassing resolution for the holding of Somali elections in the shortest possible time." Somalia's parliamentary elections were initially to take place in 2020 and the presidential election in February 2021, but both were delayed due to squabbles among stakeholders and disagreements on modalities for voting. In April 2021, the Lower House of Parliament voted for the extension of Federal President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo's term of office, but this was later revoked.
