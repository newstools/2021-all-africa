The High Court has declared the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) illegal, null and void, dealing a death blow to President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga's four-years-long efforts to change the constitution. The court declared that Kenyatta acted in excess of his powers when he formed and initiated the BBI constitutional amendment process and that he violated chapter six of the Constitution on leadership and integrity, for attempting to change the Constitution through the unconstitutional process of the BBI. The court also stated that there is no other permissible avenue of amending the constitution except parliamentary or popular initiatives.
