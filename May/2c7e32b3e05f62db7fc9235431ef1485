The Football Kenya Federation Premier League has returned under strict sports resumption protocols released by the Ministry of Sports. All sports activities were halted on March 26 owing to a rise in the number of coronavirus cases but during Labour Day celebrations, President Uhuru Kenyatta allowed the resumption of sports on condition that the Health and Sports ministries issue safety guidelines to be adhered to. Measures in the guidelines include fumigation of the pitch at intervals before, during and after a match, and all games will still be played behind closed doors.
