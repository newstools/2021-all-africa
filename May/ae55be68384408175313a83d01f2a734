Sudan's ruling Sovereign Council removed Chief Justice Neimat Abdallah Mohamed Khair from the bench and accepted the resignation of Attorney General Taj Al Sir Al Hibir late May 17, 2021 without offering an explanation for either decision. Judge Khair was appointed Sudan's first woman chief justice in October 2019, six months after the Sudanese military removed Omar al-Bashir from power, in response to months of mass pro-democracy demonstrations. Al Hibir told VOA's South Sudan In Focus he resigned because he had not been given enough political space to work independently. More than 20 qualified public prosecutors were relieved of their posts earlier this month by a government committee tasked with removing elements of Bashir's administration and recovering stolen funds. According to Al Hibir, that was a case of government agencies overstepping their boundaries.
