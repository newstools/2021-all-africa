State media has confirmed that the military launched air strikes on the capital of the northern Tigray region, hours after the government denied that the attacks took place.  The UN has expressed "deep concern" about the escalation of violence in Mekele, while the humanitarian crisis deepens amid the killings, looting and destruction of health centres and farming infrastructure. UN Chief António Guterres wants "the parties to prioritize the welfare of the people and to provide the necessary support for critical humanitarian assistance to flow". In Tigray, Amhara and Afar, up to seven million people are in dire need of food assistance, according to the World Food Programme (WFP), as reports emerge of the Tigray fighters moving south to an area where displaced people have sought refuge.
