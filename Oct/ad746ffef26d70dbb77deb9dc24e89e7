The UK government will from October 11, 2021 remove 47 countries and territories from its Red List barring citizens from entering the UK due to Covid-19 travel restrictions. The restrictions it said at the time, were to prevent further variants of Covid-19 from entering the country. Among the African countries removed from the list are South Africa, whose experts made representations to the UK government on the South African government's Covid-19 vaccination campaign, and Zimbabwe and Tanzania.

The removal from the red list will mean -among others - that travellers will no longer be required to undergo a ten-day approved hotel quarantine on arrival in the UK, at their cost.  Also, by removing the countries from the red list, British travellers will no longer be required to quarantine in hotels when they return home. This move brings relief to the tourism sector which creates thousands of jobs and plays a large part in the economy of African countries.
