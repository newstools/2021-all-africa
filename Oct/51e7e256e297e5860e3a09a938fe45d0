The World Health Organization (WHO) and partners have issued an urgent call for concrete action to better protect health and care workers worldwide from Covid-19 and other health issues. The organizations are concerned that large numbers of health and care workers have died from Covid-19, but also that an increasing proportion of the workforce are suffering from burnout, stress, anxiety and fatigue. In a Joint Statement, WHO and partners called on all Member State governments and stakeholders to strengthen the monitoring and reporting of Covid-19 infections, ill-health and deaths among health and care workers. As of October 22, confirmed cases of Covid-19 from 55 African countries reached 8,453,282 while over 106,010,059 vaccinations have been administered across the continent.
