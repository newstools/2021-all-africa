President Uhuru Kenyatta has lifted the dusk-to-dawn curfew that has been in effect since March 2020. The curfew was initially imposed as part of measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the country. Kenyatta, speaking at the 58th Mashujaa Day celebrations at the Wang'uru Stadium in Kirinyaga County, said that 5 million adults have been vaccinated so far against Covid-19. Howeer he warned that even though novel coronavirus infections had dropped, the country was not yet out of the woods. The president's move to lift the curfew, follows appeals from stakeholders in Kenya's business community as well as lobbying from churches to lift restrictions and allow more congregants to gather.  As of October 20, 2021 has recorded 252,199 coronavirus cases, 245,577 recoveries and 5,233 deaths. 3,338,391 have been vaccinated.
