The Ethiopian national army has reportedly launched heavy air and ground offensives against the positions of Tigray forces in the Amhara region of northern Ethiopia, the East African reports. Reuters is quoting Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) spokesman Getachew Reda and a diplomatic source as saying that the rebels have been under airstrikes and heavy artillery fire. "There is a massive build-up of forces on all fronts ... There are artillery and drones being used," said Getachew.           The New Humanitarian is also reporting an offensive by the Ethiopian government. "We're going to see more civilian suffering; more troops being killed; another round of military bloodshed," Mengistu Assefa, an Ethiopian analyst and political commentator, told the publication.           The reported offensive comes after seven senior UN officials were thrown out of Ethiopia for allegedly "meddling" in the country's affairs. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the decision - announced late last month - was "unprecedented" and violated international law.           Since the Tigray conflict broke out in November 2020, tens of thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced.
