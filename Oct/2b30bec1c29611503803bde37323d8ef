Some 30 delegations are travelling to Libya's capital Tripoli to participate in an international conference geared at building stability in the deeply divided country, ahead of crucial presidential elections in December 2021.           Among them are representatives from the United Nations, European Union, African Union and the Arab League.           Taking places under a UN peace process that seeks to end a decade of conflict, the polls are seen as a pivotal moment in bringing democracy through a credible transition of power.           While the presidential vote will take place on December 24, legislative elections have been delayed until 2022 amid a bitter disagreement over legal and constitutional rules.           Libya is being crippled by an east-west divide. The parliament is based in the eastern city of Tobruk, while the rival High State Council, which acts as the Senate, is in Tripoli. The legislative vote had been due to take place in tandem with the presidential election, but the Tobruk parliament said they would instead take place at the end of January, 2022.
