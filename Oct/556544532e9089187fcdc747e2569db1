UN-appointed independent rights experts have said state security forces in South Sudan have been responsible for imposing new and potentially arbitrary restrictions against the country's most prominent civil society leaders, issuing "credible" death threats that have undermined peace efforts.           The actions of the National Security Services (NSS) have included detentions, raids, a likely internet shutdown and an enhanced security presence on the streets of Juba, the panel said in a statement.           Those targeted by threats, harassment and intimidation have included prominent human rights defenders, journalists and civil society players. Many have played a key role in the country's peace and justice processes.           The UN Commission - which was appointed by the Human Rights Council in March 2016 to investigate crimes linked to civil war that erupted in 2011 - noted that this public assembly could not take place amid threats, detentions and raids.
