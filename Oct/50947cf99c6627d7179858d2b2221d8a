Guinea's military president Colonel Mamady Doumbouya has appointed a former diplomat Mohamed Béavogui as prime minister in the transitional government.           Béavogui, who once served as the UN Assistant Secretary-General, was named on October 6, 2021 through a presidential decree read on state broadcaster RTG.           Col. Mamady Doumbouya, the newly sworn-in Guinean transition coup leader and president has promised to stick to his government's terms of transition charter and will step down after the elections.           Guinea held its first democratic elections in 2010 which saw long time opposition activist Alpha Conde elected. But after serving his two-term constitutional mandate, President Conde controversially changed the constitution and ran for a third term.           A little over halfway into the first year of his third term, a group soldiers from the special forces led by Doumbouya, seized power on September 5, 2021. The military accused the deposed president of maladministration and human rights violations, among others.
