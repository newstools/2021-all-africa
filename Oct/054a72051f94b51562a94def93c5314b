Ethiopian farmers in the regions of Amhara and Oromia are preparing to export avocados to the international market, writes Tewodros Kassa for the Ethiopian Herald. Nine agricultural clusters in the Amhara region will soon begin exporting Hass (dark green and bumpy type) avocados cultivated on 200 hectares of land, Ethiopia's Agricultural Transformation Agency announced. The Agency related that 447 farmers in North Mecha Woreda of West Gojjam Zone are taking part in producing export-standard avocado produce. Ethiopia's landscape and climate are conducive to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. The country is said to have a particularly eco-friendly environment with enormous potentials to become the major producer and exporter of fruits and vegetables.
