The fragile nature of the security situation in Sudan was exposed by a deadly gunfight in Gabra on September 29, 2021. Authorities arrested 11 alleged terror suspects following the battle in which five Sudan General Intelligence Service members were killed. Sudan's history of terrorism goes back to the 1970s and was amplified during the 1990s, when it harboured A-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. It was also found to have assisted Al-Qaeda in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Only after the ouster of former president Omar al-Bashir and the payment of U.S.$335 million in compensation to the victims of several terror attacks, did Washington remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terror. Analysts have blamed the current violence on the presence of foreign militants in the country and the transitional nature of the military-civilian government that has governed Sudan since 2019, when al-Bashir was ousted by the military after months of protests. Khalifa Sidiq, a professor at the International University of Africa in Khartoum who is an expert on Islamist groups, told the Voice of America that Sudan's proximity to other troubled states contributes to the problem.
