On Saturday, hundreds of people thronged the street of Kairaba Avenue and embarked on the Never Again Solidarity March and demanded the full implementation of Truth Reconciliation and Reparation recommendations.           The Commission's final report was supposed to be submitted to President Adama Barrow on September 30th but the commission requested another more time to enable them complete the entire report and recommendations.           the Victims' Centre said the victim community is concerned with the continuous delay in the submission of the final TRRC report and recommendations. The Centre has also issued five-point demands, among them is for the final TRRC recommendations to be submitted to the president as soon as possible.           According to John Charles Njie, the chairman of the country's CSOs, the purpose of the solidarity march was to stand in solidarity with victims of human rights violations and their family members was to remind the government of their sacred obligation to ensure that the baby born of the TRRC is not aborted.
