Somalia reported its first case of Covid-19 on March 16, 2020. To date, the overall death toll provided by the Somali government stands at 1,180, and the number of positive cases are at 21,269.           Researchers however say there has been a considerable undercount in cases among the population. The new study says Covid-19 deaths were at least 32 times higher than the figures reported by the government during the early months of the pandemic. The study, published by the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, estimates that between 3,200 to 11,800 people died from the effects of Covid-19 between March and September 2020 in the capital, Mogadishu.           Somalia country representative for the World Health Organization Dr. Mamunur Rahman Malik, said that the study lacks some degree of precision. Malik said the death toll figure given by the government, is only based on those who died of Covid-19 at health facilities. He said the registration system to capture deaths among the community does not exist in Somalia.
