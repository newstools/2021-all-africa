High Court judge, Justice Pisirayi Kwenda has quashed all three corruption charges levelled against former health minister Obadiah Moyo, who was remanded in custody since his surprise arrest in June 2020. The arrest preceded his being fired by President Emmerson Mnangagwa as Health Minister. Moyo has since been replaced as minister by Constantino Chiwenga who is also Zimbabwe's vice president. Moyo was accused of abuse of office after he allegedly corruptly issued U.S.$60 million in tenders to supply Covid-19 test kits and medical equipment to obscure companies linked to the political elite. He became the second minister in the Mnangagwa administration to be arrested for corruption, with the other being former Tourism minister, Prisca Mupfumira.
