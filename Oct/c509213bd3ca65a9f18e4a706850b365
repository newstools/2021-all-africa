Over the past few months, relations between the military and civilian components of the Sudanese transitional government that came into power after the removal of long time dictator president, Omar al-Bashir, have become increasingly strained. A coup attempt in September 2021 was thwarted but brought to attention the country's precarious political situation. In a latest development, the Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdook has been arrested by the Joint military forces on October 25, 2021 after he refused to support their "coup", the information ministry has said. Other members of the transitional government have also been detained and taken to an unidentified location, according to a report by Radio France Internationale. Monitoring organizations report that Internet service has been disrupted. The coup has been condemned by various governments, including the United States, and by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development in Eastern Africa.
