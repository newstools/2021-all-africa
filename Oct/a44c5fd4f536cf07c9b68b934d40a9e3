Cameroon's Prime Minister Joseph Dion Ngute on a visit to the restive western regions, called for armed separatists to lay down their weapons or be killed. Ngute said Cameroonian president Paul Biya sent him to ask for an end to fighting, killing and the destruction of property. He said most Cameroonians want an end to the separatist crisis.           He was met with shooting in Matazen, an English-speaking village bordering the French-speaking West region of Cameroon. He was rushed to his car. Ngute told hundreds of civilians in Bamenda that he was the bearer of a special message. He spoke in Pidgin, a popular language in Cameroon's English-speaking western regions. Civilians and rights groups say peace will only return if the government declares a cease-fire.

Fighting between various armed separatist groups and the Cameroonian armed forces has continued unabated for the past five years, with civilians bearing the brunt of unlawful killings, kidnappings, and widespread destruction of houses and villages. Government intervention has been limited, and there has been near-complete silence from the international community.
