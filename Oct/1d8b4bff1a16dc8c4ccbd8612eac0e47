Former captain of the national cricket team Quinton de Kock has apologised for not taking the knee during a Twenty20 World Cup match against the West Indies, Deutsche Welle reports. He pulled out of the match rather than make the gesture in support of Black Lives Matter (BLM) and racism in sport. In a statement on October 26, 2021 de Kock said he "would like to start by saying sorry to my teammates, and the fans back home." "If me taking a knee helps to educate others, and makes the lives of others better, I am more than happy to do so," de Kock said.  Over the past two years, the act of taking a knee before the start of a game has been adopted by sportspeople as a sign of solidarity for the BLM movement and one that Cricket South Africa instructed players of the national team to adopt as well.
