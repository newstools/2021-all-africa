A new agreement between 136 nations addresses the way in which multinationals transfer profits earned in one country and shift them to a "tax haven" - a country with a lower tax rate - thus denying tax revenue to the governments of countries in which the profits are made.  While African nations are most frequently the victims of tax avoidance, most often by mining and financial enterprises, some have been named by the Europe-based Tax Justice Network as offenders to one degree or another and lists nine African countries in its ranking of the 70 jurisdictions "most complicit in helping multinational corporations underpay corporate income tax." Five of them have signed up to the new Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development agreement, the most important of which is Mauritius which is widely recognised as a tax haven and is at 15th place on the network's list of tax havens, writes John Allen for allAfrica.
