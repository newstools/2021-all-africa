The Zimbabwe government is trying to encourage more citizens to get the Covid-19 jab and has introduced measures to speed up a rather slow uptake. Bars has now been given the go-ahead to reopen but only to fully vaccinated patrons. The southern African country shut down pubs, bars and night clubs early in 2020 when it imposed the first national lockdown to control the spread of Covid-19. Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa has said that all Zimbabwean civil servants must now be vaccinated against Covid-19 before being allowed to work, while churches are permitted to move from 100 people at a service to half their capacity if congregants are fully vaccinated. Mutsvangwa has said following a cabinet meeting, Zimbabwe had seen a sharp decline in infections with the recovery rate now at 94%. While Zimbabwe has had a smooth Covid-19 vaccination rollout, only 15,9% of the population are fully vaccinated. Zimbabwe has recorded more than 131,434 cases of Covid-19, including 4,630 deaths and 124,331 recoveries since the start of the pandemic.
