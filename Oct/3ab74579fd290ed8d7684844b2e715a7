South African President Cyril Ramaphosa who is chairperson of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Organ on Defence, Politics and Security Cooperation, has appointed Special Envoys to engage with King Mswati III of the Kingdom of eSwatini on security and political developments there. This comes after fresh pro-democratic protests flared up again, months after authorities quashed a round of protests in June 2021. The delegation includes Jeffrey Radebe, a former South African government minister, and Candith Mashego-Dlamini, South Africa's deputy minister of international relations and cooperation, as well as representatives from Botswana and Namibia. Protests against the authoritarian monarchy escalated, following the shooting of a student in mid-May, 2021. Swazi Media Commentary reported that marches took place in at least 10 places, mainly in rural areas, despite the king placing a ban on protests. Reports indicated that as many as 19 people had been shot dead, allegedly by the military.           "Whatever happens at eSwatini has a negative impact not only on South Africa but on the Southern African region. I don't think there are problems that are big or small. If we sit around the table there must be solutions. I will go to eSwatini with an open mind. We are committed as Africans to Agenda 2063 of The Africa We Want to See - that is the objective at the end of the day. Our mission is simple, though I know that the issues are very complex. It is our responsibility for us to simplify the issues, so that we can come to a lasting solution to the nation of eSwatini," Jeff Radebe said.
