The World Health Organization has launched the Strategy to Achieve Global Covid-19 Vaccination by mid-2022 (the Strategy) to help bring an end to what has become a two-track pandemic: people in poorer countries continue to be at risk, while those in richer countries with high vaccination rates enjoy much greater protection. WHO had set a target to vaccinate 10% of every country, economy and territory by the end of September but by that date 56 countries had not been able to do so, the vast majority of these are countries in Africa and the Middle East. The new strategy outlines a plan for achieving WHO's targets to vaccinate 40% of the population of every country by the end of this year and 70% by mid-2022. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: "This is a costed, coordinated and credible path out of the Covid-19 pandemic for everyone, everywhere. Without a coordinated, equitable approach, a reduction of cases in any one country will not be sustained over time. For everyone's sake, we must urgently bring all countries to a high level of vaccination coverage." Vaccinating 70% of the global population requires at least 11 billion vaccine doses and, by the end of September 2021, just over 6 billion doses had already been administered worldwide.
