The price of a Covid antigen test is U.S.$24 at testing centres, but the wholesale price is about U.S.$9, and in other countries it's much cheaper, according to GroundUp which slammed the "bureaucratic approach" to Covid-19 testing.       Meanwhile, Mpiko Ntsekhe and Tracey Naledi of Daily Maverick write that the deafening silence from the South African government on vaccine mandates that have proven effective elsewhere around the globe, is hard to understand. Opponents of vaccine mandates contest their overwhelming benefit for the greater good - versus individual and societal risk, for example, potential loss of access to social services, education and employment - especially if vaccine mandates are not implemented responsibly. It should not be forgotten that the fourth wave is projected for some time in December 2021. And, as with the first three iterations of the battle in this war, society's healthcare and other resources will get redirected to the Covid-19 effort with often devastating, but little spoken-about "collateral" damage to the most vulnerable members of society. As of October 25, 2021, a total of 2,919,632 cases have been confirmed of which 88,925 proved fatal and 2,811,439 resulted in recovery.
