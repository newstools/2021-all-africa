eSwatini has deployed soldiers and police to multiple schools, as learners continue to demand political reform in Africa's last kingdom. Among learners' demands, is the release of two lawmakers who were arrested during pro-democracy protests earlier in 2021. The country has been criticised by the international community over the past few months for use of excessive force against protesters. At least 27 people have been killed in clashes with police. The protests come after King Mswati III fled his country as pro-democracy protests turned violent and the nation's communist party alleged he'd flown in his private jet to neighbouring South Africa.
