A storm has erupted in Deputy President William Ruto's United Democratic Alliance (UDA) over a new list of 31 party officials, which some members have called "unsatisfactory". UDA chairman Johnston Muthama has said the officials would be members of the party's National Executive Committee, which will have an influence in party elections and nominations. Some disgruntled leaders are protesting that positions have gone to some late entrants and have complained they had either been left out, or their regions ignored. Protests were so acrimonious that Secretary-General Veronica Maina in an attempt to calm members, reportedly posted a statement in a party members' WhatsApp group contesting the list, writes Justus Ochieng for The Nation. Ruto has reportedly not personally come out to identify himself with the UDA party and it's not entirely clear if he will be running for the presidency in the 2022 general election as a candidate of the UDA, after his fallout with President Uhuru Kenyatta.
