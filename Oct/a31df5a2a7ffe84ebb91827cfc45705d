President Cyril Ramaphosa has thanked the public for responding to his invitation to participate in the process of nominating the next Chief Justice of South Africa. This comes after eight nominees were shortlisted from a list of 25 candidates for the position.  The list comprises: Judge President John Hlophe, Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga, Justice Mandisa Maya, Dr Wallace Amos Mgoqi, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, Judge President Dunstan Mlambo, Advocate. Alan Nelson, SC and Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo South Africans are now permitted to submit in writing any objections they may have regarding the nominees by Friday, 15 October 2021. The panel will consider objections before submittinga shortlist of three to five names to the President. The tenure of incumbent Mogoeng Mogoeng has been marked by successes like being named head of the African Judicial Congress and making landmark rulings ordering former president Jacob Zuma to pay back the money used to upgrade the former president's Nkandla homestead and that political parties must disclose sources of private funding. However, Mogoeng has also been noted for raising controversies. These include making pro-Israel statements during a webinar that drew the ire of pro-Palestinian activists and which the Judicial Conduct Committee ruled he should apologise for, and remarking that infusing religion into the law might lead to high moral fibre in the country.
