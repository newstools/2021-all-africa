President Samia Suluhu of Tanzania and President Évariste Ndayishimiye of Burundi, have agreed to continue cooperating in improving business and investment environments to attract more investment into their countries. The two countries signed multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects, with their sights on the huge DR Congo market, where the construction of roads and standard gauge railway lines will connect Tanzania and Burundi. The construction of the Uvinza-Msongati-Gitega railway line will run for 240km, with at least 160km of the line running through Tanzania. The two governments have also identified areas of cooperation that would enable their citizens to benefit from various business opportunities, although insecurity in Burundi was identfied as one of the shortcomings blocking trade growth between the two nations. The meeting between the two leaders took place in Dodoma, Tanzania, where Ndayishimiye is on a four-day visit.
