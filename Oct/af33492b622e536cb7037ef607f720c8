Globally, at least 1 in 7 children has been directly affected by lockdowns, while more than 1.6 billion children have suffered some loss of education, according to the latest data from UNICEF. The State of the World's Children 2021 report has called on governments, and public and private sector partners, to commit, communicate and act to promote mental health for all children, adolescents and caregivers, protect those in need of help, and care for the most vulnerable. Powerful emotions like uncertainty, loneliness and grief have enveloped the lives of many millions of children, young people and families. Children and young people could feel the impact of Covid-19 on their mental health and well-being for many years to come, according to the report. The report says governments and societies are investing far too little in promoting, protecting and caring for the mental health of children, young people and their caregivers.
