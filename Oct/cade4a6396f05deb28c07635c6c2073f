For more than 40 years Julienne Lusenge has been working tirelessly to help victims of wartime sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Her courage and efforts to expose perpetrators and bring them to justice were rewarded at a special ceremony on the small island of San Lazzaro of the Armenians in the Venice lagoon when she was declared the winner of the Aurora Prize. The Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity every year recognizes the extraordinary humanitarian work of individuals at a global level and the impact of their actions. Noubar Afeyam, one of the three co-founders of the Aurora Prize, described it as "a gift from the Armenian community to the world". The prize is granted by the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative on behalf of the survivors of the Armenian Genocide and in gratitude to their saviors. As the winner, Lusenge will receive a U.S.$1,000,000 grant and a chance to continue the cycle of giving by supporting organizations that help people in need.
