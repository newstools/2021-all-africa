U.S. President Joe Biden has asked Kenya to play a central role in securing the Horn region, even as he pledged to donate a further 17 million doses of J&J Covid-19 jabs to the African Union.        At a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta at the White House, Biden said Kenya, a traditional ally of Washington, would play a significant role, especially now that the region faces various crises.        Kenyatta is the first African head to meet with Biden since he took over in January, and it is his fourth visit to the White House under three different American presidents. He said he welcomed U.S. support to end crises in the region, as well as to develop trade.        The meeting came as Kenya presides over the UN Security Council for the month of October. But it also comes as Kenya faces violence in Laikipia which police say is fuelled by bandits. Kenya is also preparing for general election in 2022 with uncertainties surrounding the security situation after the vote. The previous two general elections were followed by sporadic incidents of violence, writes Aggrey Mutambo for The Nation.
