South Africans are set to cast their ballots on November 1 in local government elections after months of campaigns, in an election that earlier in the year seemed uncertain would happen.  More than 10,000 councillors have to be elected. For this reason, more than 95,000 candidates have been nominated, including more than 1,500 independent candidates. The election is not only about who will govern the municipalities. It will also show what is happening in party politics in South Africa, what the latest trends are, how the still relatively new leaders of some parties are performing, whether identity politics is emerging as a feature of South African politics, and whether coalition governments are a long-term feature or a transitional phenomenon, Dirk Kotze writes for The Conversation. Meanwhile, Health Minister Joe Phaahla has announced that 1,000 voting stations in South Africa will have pop-up vaccination sites on election day.
