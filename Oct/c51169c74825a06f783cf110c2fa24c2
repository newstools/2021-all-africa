The UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for South Sudan and Head of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), Nicholas Haysom on September 15, 2021 voiced his concerns at the increase in localised violence in the country.           Some of the conflicts are due to the fracture within the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLM/A-IO) that occurred in April 2021. A recent analysis by the Institute for Security Studies shows that the split which led to violence, is disrupting the unification of the army - a vital part of the peace agreement.           In the absence of a functional state, localised conflicts also make it difficult to get humanitarian support to South Sudan's vulnerable populations. Aid workers are increasingly attacked, and marauding groups destroy much-needed items and assets.
