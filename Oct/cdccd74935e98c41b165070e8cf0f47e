Kizza Besigye, former Forum for Democratic Change leader, says he is unsure how and why, information on the withdrawal of his treason case is only coming out now. The treason charges were levelled against the former presidential candidate for allegedly swearing himself in, as the president after the 2016 polls handed President Yoweri Museveni another term in office.           The news of the withdrawal comes as opposition and activists are questioning President Museveni's proposal to deny bail to capital offenders and or expedite determination of murder cases, saying that doing so would deliver justice to victims. Lawyers, activists and opposition parties including the Democratic Party (DP) disagreed with this proposal saying that scrapping the right to bail for presumed capital offenders is a strap for dissenting leaders. Besigye has challenged Museveni for the country's presidency four times since 2001 and has on each occasion accused him of rigging the elections. He has gone to the Supreme Court twice - in 2001 and 2006 - to challenge the election results. In the 2021 presidential race he decided not to run for the presidency because he said: "I was angry over leaders failing to understand the political dynamics of the time and instead, turning to fight for political positions".
