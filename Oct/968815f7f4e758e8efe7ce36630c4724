Medical aid groups support plans by U.S. drug maker Moderna to build a plant for manufacturing vaccines in Africa, writes Victoria Amunga for Voice of America. The groups say the plant, the first from a company making a Covid-19 vaccine, will help in fighting vaccine inequality. African countries are facing a shortfall of nearly 500 million Covid-19 vaccines according to the World Health Organization. The shortage has left most countries unable to vaccinate even the most vulnerable 10% of their populations. The move comes several months after Pfizer and BioNTech reached an agreement with a South African company to produce their Covid-19 vaccine for distribution in Africa. Calls for Africa to be an equal partner in the Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing process have been made previously, notably by President Paul Kagame of Rwanda who spoke at the Qatar Economic Forum in June 2021. As of October 13, 2021 confirmed cases of Covid-19 from 55 African countries reached 8,399,836 while over 99,691,947 vaccinations have been administered across the continent.
