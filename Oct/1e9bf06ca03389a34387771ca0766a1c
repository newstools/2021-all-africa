The State of Disaster enacted due to the Covid-19 outbreak has been extended to November 15, 2021, the government said in a statement. The Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Ministry (Cogta) said the decision followed consultations with relevant stakeholders and Cabinet approval. "The extension takes into account the need to continue observing all non-pharmaceutical interventions against Covid-19 and increasing vaccinations as part of contingency measures being undertaken to mitigate against its impact," Cogta Minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma said. This comes after government confirmed that a total of 34.7% of the adults in the country have received at least one dose of the Pfizer or the Johnson & Johnson single-shot Covid-19 vaccine as of October 14, 2021. Full vaccinations to date total 10,370,743, translating to 26.06% of the country's adult population.
