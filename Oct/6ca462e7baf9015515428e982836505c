Somalia militia, Ahlu Sunna Wal Jamaa (ASWJ), has agreed to a ceasefire following talks brokered by the local business community, bringing an end to days of bloodshed in the federal state of Galmudug. The AWSJ was allied with government forces against Al-Shabaab but fell out over power-sharing arrangements in the local federal administration, writes Aggrey Mutambo and Abdulkadir Khalif for Daily Nation. Meanwhile, the U.S. is reviewing its support of the Somali army's elite military group Danab, after fighting in the town of Guriel that pitted government troops and Galmudug regional forces against militia group ASWJ. ASWJ are opposing Al-Shabaab, a militant group which the U.S. says is the biggest threat to stability in the region, writes Falastine Iman for Voice of America.
