Rising temperatures and a decline in rainfall across eight Southern and East African countries are set to slash the production of important food crops in the region by 2050, says a new study. And even when climate change produces improved rainfall, it will be too unpredictable to enable proper planning to take advantage of it. These are among the conclusions reached by scientists from the University of Cape Town who assessed how crops, particularly staple foods grown by subsistence farmers, will survive climate change. The scientists' report - covering Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe - has been released by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the specialised United Nations agency which works to improve food security. Governments which have signed up to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change aim to keep the rise in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees centigrade - ideally 1.5 degrees - above pre-industrial levels. The new report, issued by IFAD days before the next round in Glasgow of the 26th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the convention (COP26), is pessimistic about the prospects in the countries it covers.
