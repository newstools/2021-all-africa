Two men were arrested when a Covid-19 anti-vaccination and anti-mask demonstration turned violent in Sea Point, Cape Town, writes Sandisiwe Shoba for Daily Maverick. Both were released with a warning and will appear in the Cape Town Magistrates' Court on November 17, 2021. About 40 protesters gathered at the Sea Point Promenade for a peaceful march which went awry when the group failed to heed warnings from the police. A scuffle between several protesters and SAPS officers ensued, resulting in the arrests. This is the fifth protest of its kind held in Cape Town this year. The previous one was held in August outside Groote Schuur Hospital.
