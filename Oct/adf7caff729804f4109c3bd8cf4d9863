Eliud Kipchoge has won the Best Male Athlete accolade during the 2021 Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) Awards held in Greece. Kipchoge delivered a masterclass in marathon running, breaking away at the 30-kilometre mark and never looking back, to retain his Olympic title in two hours, eight minutes and 38 seconds during the Tokyo Olympics in August 2021. He became only the third man to defend the Olympic men's marathon title after Ethiopia's Abebe Bikila in 1960 and 1964, and East Germany's Waldemar Cierpinski  in 1976 and 1980. The victory at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics was Kipchoge's 13th success in the 15 marathons he has raced in since 2013. He broke the world record in 2018 when he timed 2:01.39 in the Berlin Marathon. On October 12, 2019, Kipchoge timed 1:59.40 at the Ineos 1:59 Challenge in Vienna, Austria. But the time did not count as a new marathon record since standard competition rules were not followed, writes Brian Yonga for The Nation.
