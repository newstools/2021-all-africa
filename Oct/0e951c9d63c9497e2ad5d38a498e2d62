In Nigeria, military personnel are deployed for internal operations to combat terrorism, armed banditry, kidnapping, and other forms of insecurity. This means frequent relocations, and sometimes even international assignments bring consequences to the families of personnel.  Military postings are regular exercises carried out within the Nigerian army to reinvigorate the system for greater performance. They are also done as part of peace operations nationally and internationally. The length of postings ranges between six months and two years depending on the mission. This has reportedly carried the risks of loneliness, neglecting their homes, infidelity, unmet emotional needs, and worries about their children's education and behavior, writes Oludayo Tade for The Conversation.
