It is five years since the Panama Papers in 2016 exposed offshore companies linked to more than 140 politicians in more than 50 countries. Now in the Pandora Papers, a large number of African leaders have been named by an international consortium of journalists, as secretly owning assets overseas which show some of them to be enormously wealthy compared to the citizens of their own countries, reports AllAfrica. The investigative report which details the offshore hideaways of some of the world's most powerful personalities, is launching on October 4, 2021 after two years of discreet work by investigative journalists around the world. According to AllAfrica's publisher partner Premium Times, the Pandora Papers project is facilitated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which obtained a trove of 11.9 million confidential files.
