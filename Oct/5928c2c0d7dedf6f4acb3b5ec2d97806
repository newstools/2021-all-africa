Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are once again accessible after an outage of more than six hours. The services went offline on October 4, 2021. CNBC reports that the Internet social media giant issued a statement saying: "To the huge community of people and businesses around the world who depend on us: we're sorry. We've been working hard to restore access to our apps and services and are happy to report they are coming back online now. Thank you for bearing with us."  Facebook did not disclose what went wrong.           CNBC reports that this is worst outage for Facebook since 2008, when it was down for about a day, but the service only had 80 million users then. Facebook, which owns WhatsApp and Instagram, now has 3 billion users.
