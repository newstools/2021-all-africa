The Democratic Alliance (DA) has issued a statement about the controversial "us versus them" local government election posters erected in Phoenix, KwaZulu-Natal, and other parts of the province, saying they are being removed. "In my sincere effort to honour the bravery and heroism of law-abiding citizens who were left to fend for themselves during the July 2021 riots and insurrections, the posters have regretfully caused hurt to some people. I am deeply sorry and apologise for this," said KwaZulu-Natal DA chairperson and campaign manager Dean Macpherson. The two-tier posters are branded with the DA logo, albeit on a darker blue background, and read: "THE ANC CALLED YOU RACISTS THE DA CALLS YOU HEROES." Racial tensions flared between black South Africans and South Africans of Indian heritage in July 2021 following the killings of 36 people in Phoenix, north of Durban during unrest that affected large parts of KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. The riots were allegedly spurred by the sentencing of former president Jacob Zuma to 15 months in prison for contempt of court when he failed to appear before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture to answer allegations about his alleged role in state capture.
