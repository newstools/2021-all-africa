Cameroon is in the midst of an escalating humanitarian crisis as it battles to bring several violent conflicts under control. The main one being between government and separatists from the English-speaking minority. Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced - all while the country is also being terrorized by extremist group Boko Haram, which originated in Nigeria.      On the panel for Silencing The Guns today, allAfrica's Mantsadi Sepheka is joined by allAfrica colleague and senior editor Michael Tantoh, who has reported and edited from Cape Town's offices for more than a decade. Tantoh will share why the Cameroon finds itself in the position it does. The peacebuilding workers on the panel are Derick Fuh Neba and Divine Mbutoh from the Positive Peace Group in Cameroon, and founding member of the West Africa Centre for Peace Studies in Ghana Erasmus Migyikra Ndemole, and his colleagues Godwin Kouwoadan and Alberta Horlu.  Listen here allAfrica is grateful to the Carnegie Corporation of New York for supporting our reporting on peacebuilding in Africa.
