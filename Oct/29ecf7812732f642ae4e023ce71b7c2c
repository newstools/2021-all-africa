Since Burkina Faso began its war against armed groups linked to Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and local bandits seven years ago, at least 400 citizens have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism-related offenses and are being held in custody. Some are children under the age of sixteen.           Daouda Dialo is a Burkinabe human rights activist who runs the rights group, The Collective Against Impunity and Stigmatization of Communities. He says some detainees have been awaiting trial for as long as five years.           Burkina Faso created a penal code for terrorism offenses in 2019. But so far, only two people have been to trial and convicted on terrorism charges. President Roch Kabore said the prosecution of terror suspects will continue, despite funding concerns.
