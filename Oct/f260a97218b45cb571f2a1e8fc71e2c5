South Sudan has been on the global radar for corruption in the oil sector since it became semi-autonomous in 2005, with various international human rights organisations accusing the country's leadership of allowing the military elite to loot the sector, while most of the revenue does not reach the national budget's books.           A combined effort by the International Monetary Fund's offer of the first Rapid Credit Facility in November 2020, and a group of reform-minded South Sudanese and their external partners, are demanding accountability in the corruption-riddled oil sector, writes Fred Olouch for The East African.           A new report by the International Crisis Group titled, Oil or Nothing: Dealing with South Sudan's Bleeding Finances, released on October 6, 2021 says the pressure is showing positive signs in a country where leaders have emptied state coffers, siphoned its oil income and mortgaged its future oil revenue.
