The South African Youth Climate Action Plan (SA YCAP), is a call to national stakeholders. It also appeals to the global community to honour their climate pledges on adaptation and mitigation. Convened through the Youth Programmes at the South African Institute of International Affairs in partnership with various organisations, schools, and university groups across South Africa, the [document] (https://allafrica.com/view/resource/main/main/id/00130499.html) was drafted by young people between the ages of 13 and 30. Five core pillars inform the action plan, namely: intersectionality; advocacy and activism for climate action; good governance; systematic change; and environmental sustainability. The pillars each emphasised an inclusive and intersectional approach to climate action centred on human rights.  Nadia Odendaal, SA YCAP provincial lead, said at the launch, "Climate justice is truly social justice. I've come to realise that whatever social justice issue you're interested in, whatever you think the biggest problem facing the world is - it is tied to climate change. We can't ignore that. That is why I'm so proud we've managed to produce an intersectional document that I really hope represents a diverse group of young people, and our wishes for the future."
