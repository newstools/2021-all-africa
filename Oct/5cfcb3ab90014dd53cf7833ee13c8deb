Kenya has outperformed the global average of female board directors after witnessing significant progress in board diversity and inclusion in the last nine years, a new report shows. According to the 2021 Board Diversity and Inclusion Survey report, Kenya's gender diversity in the boardroom now stands at 36%, a significant growth from 21% in 2017. The report reveals that gender and age are critical components in driving organisational performance, decision-making and productivity. Education level and nationality the report says, influence organisational performance to some extent with professional, ethnic, and religion also having an effect on organisational performance, board decision-making process and productivity, writes Kamau Maichuhie for The Nation.
