The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission is in a legal mess following vicious fights between multinational companies over multimillion-dollar tenders for the supply of voting materials. The firms are eyeing the electoral agency's U.S.$359 million budget for the 2022 General Election. The Public Procurement Administrative Review Board has stopped a U.S.$24 million tender for the printing of ballot papers that had been awarded to a Greek firm, Inform Lykos (Hellas) SA. The High Court has also overturned the board's cancellation of a lucrative tender for purchase of ICT tools. The Greek firm won the tender on October 14, 2021 beating Dubai-based Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing LLC, which had the 2017 deal, writes Joseph Wangui for The Nation.
