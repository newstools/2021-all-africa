If Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) adopts the innovation of a new machine that enables automatic reporting of taxes by businesses to the  by a local technology firm, Kenya has an opportunity to widen its tax base extensively. The new model Electronic Tax Register (ETR) innovation by Dejavu Technologies Ltd is a response to calls by KRA for businesses to adopt Tax Invoice Management System (Tims) as an advancement to the ETR system. The company developed a prototype of the machine, which has passed several tests set by KRA after being submitted to the authority for tests on its efficacy, and now awaits licensing if it passes final test phases. Apart from curbing tax evasion, the new system is also bound to ease processes of filing taxes for businesses since KRA will be having details of their tax payments on its servers, writes Brian Ambani for The Nation.
