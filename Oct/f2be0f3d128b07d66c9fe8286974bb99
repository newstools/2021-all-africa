The fate of Kenya's maritime economy hangs in the balance as the International Court of Justice  will rule on a long-standing border dispute with Somalia on October 12, 2021. Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, Kenya holds its breath as it awaits a crucial judgment over a contested zone of the Indian Ocean that is believed to hold oil and gas deposits. The disputed triangular area measuring 62,000-square kilometres extends to parts of Mombasa and Lamu, from where Kenyan fishermen earn their living. The nation's food and nutrition security, tourism sector and shipping activities are under threat should the ICJ rule against Kenya. Somalia, which lies northeast of Kenya, wants to extend its maritime frontier along the line of the land border, in a south-easterly direction. Kenya wants the border to head out to sea in a straight line east. Nairobi maintains it has had sovereignty over the stretch since 1979. The court will determine, on the basis of international law, the complete course of the single maritime boundary dividing all the maritime areas pertaining to Somalia and to Kenya in the Indian Ocean, including in the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, writes Joseph Wangui for The Nation.
