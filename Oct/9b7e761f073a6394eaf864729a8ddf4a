One of the most prevalent natural disasters in Nigeria is perennial flooding during the rainy season in many states. Unlike some natural disasters, rainfall flooding can be controlled with proper planning and the provision of necessary infrastructure. Nigeria's flooding is mainly human-induced, with poor urban planning and inadequate environmental infrastructure being contributing factors. The extent and nature of Nigeria's flooding are such that the actual figures for displacements, losses, and fatalities cannot be truly ascertained due to poor records and reporting, writes Adaku Jane Echendu for The Conversation. President Muhammadu Buhari has said that while the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the economy, "floods have also caused large-scale destruction to farmlands, thereby impacting negatively on our efforts to boost local production in line with our policy to drastically reduce food importation". What is missing is appropriate action to mitigate the flooding. Currently, there is no flood management policy in Nigeria. The lack of relevant legal and policy frameworks is an indication of the low importance given to controlling and managing flooding in Nigeria.
