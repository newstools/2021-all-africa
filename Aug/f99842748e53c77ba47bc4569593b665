The Court of Appeal will issue a ruling on the fate of the Constitution Amendment Bill 2020 popularly known as the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI). The seven-judge bench chaired by Justice Daniel Musinga is expected to either uphold the High Court ruling that halted the Constitutional amendment reforms in the country or invalidate it all together, allowing Kenyans to head into a referendum. In the event the bench validates the High Court ruling, the proponents of the process are likely to proceed to the Supreme Court in search of a favorable ruling. Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who is among the proponents of the initiative, has since noted that he will respect the verdict that will be issued by the court. The ruling is expected to have a significant sway on Deputy President William Ruto, ODM boss Raila Odinga and the One Kenya Alliance (OKA) leaders' presidential campaign strategies. All the three campaign teams, which so far make the "big three" of those who have declared interest in next year's presidential contest, have been anticipating the BBI judgement with a keen eye on its implication for the number of the executive seats available for power sharing. Allowing the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) constitutional amendments referendum to proceed will potentially expand the number of executive slots in the governance structure, which makes it easier for presidential aspirants to build wide coalitions.
