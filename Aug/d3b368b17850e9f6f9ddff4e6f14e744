Thousands of form one learners have reportedly not taken their admission slots one week after the reporting deadline lapsed, prompting the ministry of education to intensify efforts to get them to secondary school. Some regions have admitted only about 60% of the 2020 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education candidates, dealing a blow to the government's 100% transition policy, Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has indicated. A spot check by The Nation indicates that while most national and extra-county schools have recorded high admission numbers, many learners admitted to sub-county schools are yet to report. In the North Rift region, some learners have not reported back to school due to poverty, insecurity, and teenage pregnancies.
