The South African Medical Association (SAMA) has noted  reports that some healthcare workers, including doctors, have discouraged patients from getting Covid-19 vaccinations, based on doubts about the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. SAMA Chairperson, Dr Angelique Coetzee, said the organisation wholly rejects any doubts about the Covid-19 vaccine. "There is high confidence among the scientific and medical community about the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines being rolled-out in South Africa, and they have also undergone safety and efficacy tests by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority. These are overwhelming endorsements of the vaccines, and there should be no doubt that every citizen must get them," Coetzee said. Additionally, SAMA issued a statement after a video surfaced in which well-known Cape Town heart surgeon Dr Susan Vosloo made a number of statements about Covid-19 vaccines, Daily Maverick reports. Vosloo's claims are likely to land her in hot water, with many organisations calling for steps to be taken against her. As of August 17, 2021, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the nation total 2,613,569 of which 77,440 proved fatal and 2,382,809 resulted in recovery.
