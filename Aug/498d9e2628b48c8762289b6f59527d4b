The Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, has demanded that Mali justify the alleged detention of ex-leaders Moctar Ouane and Bah Ndaw who were deposed in a coup d'etat in May 2021.           As leaders of a post-coup transitional government, they were tasked with steering the troubled Sahel state back to civilian rule by February 2020. But in May 2021, Assimi Goïta deposed Ouane and Ndaw after a government reshuffle following a second coup. The army strongman was later declared interim president himself.           The current whereabouts of Ouane and Ndaw are unknown, but they are believed to be under house arrest in Mali. Mamadou Ismaila Konate, a lawyer representing the former leaders, shared on social media, a court order demanding that the Mali government "explain the violations of the rights and freedoms" of Ouane and Ndaw by August 28, 2021.
