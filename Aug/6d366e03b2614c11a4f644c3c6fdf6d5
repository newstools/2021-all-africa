"People don't know about wheelchair basketball. They don't know that we exist and don't know much about our sport. But we are dedicated and passionate about the game of basketball," says Ntombizile Mthombeni, now head coach of the North West Stinging Bees, four-time champions of the National Women's Wheelchair Basketball League, writes Lee Nxumalo for New Frame. Despite the many challenges, Mthombeni is optimistic about the future of wheelchair basketball. Her journey as a coach has made her a better person and a better parent. Training and working with para-athletes has informed how she approaches raising her child too.
