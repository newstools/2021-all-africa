The government has ordered all civil servants to be vaccinated in two weeks or risk disciplinary action after only a few voluntarily went for the Covid-19 jab. Only 2% of Kenyans have been fully vaccinated so far. Almost 2 million Kenyans had received the first dose of the vaccine as of August 9, 2021. Of this number, about 600,000 civil servants have shown up for their second doses. Kenya has a target of vaccinating 26 million people by the end of 2022. More than half of the teachers who received the first dose have not gone for their second jab  - a worrying trend amid a variant that affects children, whom they interact with on a daily basis, writes Angela Oketch for The Nation. Coupled with this challenge, is that of secondary school overcrowding. Education stakeholders have warned that the country is courting disaster with the congestion caused by the lack of upgrades in scool infrastructure. As of August 11, 2021 Kenya has recorded 213,756 Covid-19 cases with 198,786 recoveries and 4,211 fatalities.
