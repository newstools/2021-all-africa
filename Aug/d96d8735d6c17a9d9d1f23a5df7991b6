General Daniel Sidiki Troare, the commander of U.N. peacekeeping forces in the Central African Republic, has said that militants in the country continue to challenge authorities and threaten neighbouring countries like Cameroon. Troare who is head of the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission (MINUSCA) delegation, described the situation as "fragile".  Troare said that the fundamental objective of the U.N. peacekeeping mission is to protect civilians, U.N. mission staff and offices, the country's state institutions and restore definitive peace. He added that further co-operation is needed between U.N. troops and Cameroon's military, to stop militia advances and bring back order to the country. He added that CAR militants facing reprisals from UN peacekeepers, hide on both sides of the Cameroon border. Cameroon Defence Minister Beti Asomo said that his country will send 800 troops to CAR in September 2021 to counter attacks that occur there. Asomo added that when militants block the road linking Cameroon's coastal commercial city Douala and Bangui, economic activity declines and thousands of transporters are deprived of their source of livelihood.
