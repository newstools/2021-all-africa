Zambian president-elect Hakainde Hichilema has told Zambians 'change is here' as opposition parties in neighbouring countries congratulated him on his victory. UPND supporters that had gathered just after Hichilema's victory was announced were still parading through the capital, more and more people joining them as the day went on. Speaking shortly after President Edgar Lungu conceded defeat, Hichilema also slammed the outgoing 'brutal regime'. Recalling that he had been arrested 15 times, Hichilema said there wouldn't be retribution against those who arrested political rivals.
