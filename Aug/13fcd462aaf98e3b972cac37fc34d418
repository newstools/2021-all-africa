Egyptian authorities must urgently investigate what appear to be extrajudicial executions by members of the military in North Sinai, Amnesty International has said, following their analysis of a military propaganda video.This is not the first time the Egyptian military have been accused of extrajudicial executions, though none of the previous cases have been independently investigated, the organisation said. Amnesty International is calling for these latest incidents to be investigated by the civilian authorities, not military ones.
