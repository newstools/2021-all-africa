President Yoweri Museveni has ordered for the dissolution of the board of directors of national carrier Uganda Airlines, following an investigation that revealed widespread corruption, collusion and mismanagement. Museveni has instructed Works and Transport Minister, Edward Katumba Wamala and other relevant government authorities to interdict all suspended Uganda Airlines managers and hand them over to the Inspector General of Government for possible prosecution. In the interim, the president directed that the permanent secretaries of the ministries of Works and Transport, as well of Finance, should handle matters relating to Uganda Airlines, until otherwise advised. A number of Uganda Airlines officials have been accused of extorting money from job applicants, bungling procurement contracts, recruiting relatives, friends and church members across the network, maintaining ghost workers on the airline's payroll and giving jobs to unqualified pilots at the expense of passenger  safety. The president has called for a review of all contracts of the airline of both monetary and non-monetary value. This includes among others, catering services, fuel, ground handling, uniforms and aircraft spare parts. The changes are to meet compliance with the procedures of the Public Procurement and Disposal Authority guidelines. Uganda Airlines resumed commercial services in August 2019 after it stopped operating in 2001 due to financial difficulties.
