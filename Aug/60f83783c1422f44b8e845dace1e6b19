Up to 80% of childhood cancers are curable but this is dependent on early detection and progressive treatment" says Professor Lorna Awo Renner, head of the Paediatric Oncology Unit at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana. According to UN News Service, drastic measures to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the heightened focus by health systems on their response, led to disruptions in other essential health services in Africa. Cancer screening and treatment, including for childhood cancers, were hit especially hard. "We estimate that more than 28,000 children died of cancer in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020. This is truly heartbreaking as childhood cancers are curable if detected early and comprehensive care provided," said Dr Jean-Marie Dangou, Noncommunicable Diseases programme co-ordinator at the WHO regional office for Africa.
