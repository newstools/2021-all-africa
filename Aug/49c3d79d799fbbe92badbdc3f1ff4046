Authorities have reiterated their urgent appeal to the public and all sectors in the Nile valley "to take the necessary precautionary measures and exercise caution", as flood levels continue to rise. In the capital Khartoum, which lies at the confluence of the Blue Nile and the White Nile, the river recorded a level of 16.86 metres on August 7, 2021, exceeding the flood level by 36 centimetres, up from 24 centimetres on August 6, 2021. The Sudanese Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources announced via the official Sudan News Agency, that the water volume of the Blue Nile has been registered at 744 million cubic metres (m3), while further downstream, the Atbara river which flows into the mainstream of the Nile at the Sudan-Ethiopia border, recorded 230 million m3.           The ministry's Flood Committee has predicted that the Roseires-Sennar sector of the Nile will witness stability, the Sennar-Khartoum sector will witness a rise of three centimetres and the Khartoum-Shendi sector will see a rise of eight centimetres. While the Shendi-Atbara sector is expected to remain stable, the stretch from Atbara to Merowe, further swollen by the Atbara river, will see a rise of 11 centimetres, and the Merowe-Dongola sector can expect a rise of four centimetres.           The official death toll from floods and torrential rains this year has risen to 24 across the country. Many of the victims died from electrocution, or when buildings and houses collapsed.           Meanwhile the Khartoum State's civil defense authority has cautioned the citizens not to go closer to the River Nile or swim in it, saying that wild crocodiles and deadly snakes have been seen in and around the river.
