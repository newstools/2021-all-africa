Nigeria's government is in the process of rolling out a digital identity system to enable easier access to public and private services. But, like those and other digital ID projects around the world, Nigeria's initiative has been dogged by privacy concerns, with citizens and rights groups saying the country's lack of data protection leaves their personal information open to abuse.  Communications Minister Isa Ali Pantami issued a directive mandating citizens to link their mobile numbers to their identity numbers by October 31, 2021 or risk being blocked from accessing telecommunications services. The Nigerian government has said the 11-digit National Identification Number (NIN) is the foundation for a comprehensive digital ID system that will help to tackle insurgency and other crimes. NIN enrolment involves the recording of an individual's demographic data and capturing their fingerprints, photo, and digital signature. The number is required for all transactions requiring identity verification, such as opening a bank account, applying for a driver's license, voting, getting health insurance, and filing tax returns.
