Since October 2017, the northern province of Mozambique, Cabo Delgado has been suffering violent attacks by armed militants. At least 700,000 people, including at least 364,000 children, are now displaced in the provinces of Cabo Delgado, Nampula, Niassa, Sofala and Zambezia as a result of violence and insecurity. At least 2,852 people have reportedly died in the conflict, including 1,409 civilians, although this number includes only reported deaths and it is expected that the true number is much higher. International lobbyists, Human Rights Watch is urging the Mozambican government to help civilians trapped by the fighting, by moving them to safer areas.
