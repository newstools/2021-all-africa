Kidnappers have released learners of the Salihu Tanko Islamiyya School in Tegina, Niger State, who were taken on May 30, 2021. However, six of the 136 learners have reportedly died of cold, malnutrition, and fever. In July, kidnappers seized a man who was sent to deliver a ransom payment to secure the learners' release. Parents and school administrators had sold possessions and part of the school's land to pay the ransom. But the kidnappers later said they wanted more money. Armed groups are blamed for a series of raids on schools in northern Nigeria in recent months, taking more than 1,000 learners since December 2020.
