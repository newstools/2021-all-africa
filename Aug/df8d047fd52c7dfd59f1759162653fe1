Kenya featured prominently on August 8 as curtains were drawn on the 32nd Olympic Games, with Tokyo organisers overcoming huge challenges, most significantly rising coronavirus cases and growing opposition to the staging of the world's greatest sporting spectacle, writes Elias Makori for The Nation. Kenya came out as the best African nation and 19th overall, with 10 medals - four gold, four silver and two bronze - all from athletics. Team Nigeria was placed 74th at the end of the 2020 Tokyo Games and eighth best among the 54 African nations at the Games. Tanzania failed to win a medal after sending three representatives, all of whom were marathoners.
