Covid-19-driven economic and social difficulties in Malawi have caused an increase in sex trafficking in the southern African country,  and the spike is being blamed mainly on poor law enforcement, an NGO called People Serving Girls at Risk (PSGR) has said. PSGR records show that prior to the pandemic, it was receiving about two to three sex trafficking case referrals every week, and that has now risen to seven or more. "in one of the worst-case scenarios, we rescued about 43 girls," said Caleb Ng'ombo, director of the organization. Malawi has stringent laws against trafficking and exploitation including the 2015 Trafficking in Persons Act, which criminalized sex and labor trafficking. The legislation also provides for punishment of up to 14 years in prison for offenses involving an adult victim, and up to 21 years for those involving a child victim.
