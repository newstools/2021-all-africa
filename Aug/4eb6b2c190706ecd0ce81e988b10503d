Scorpio, the investigative arm of South African publisher Daily Maverick, has published a report revealing that "following  months of investigation" U.S.$45,000 from the department of health's allegedly corrupt communications service provider Digital Vibes contract paid for starting a nail outlet owned by Sthoko Mkhize. Mkhize is married to Dedani, the son of South African Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize. The report went on to say their investigations also found that more than U.S.$30,485 was "diverted from the U.S.$10.3 million department of health contract" to the bank account of a new hair business, Gold Ace Cuts and Curls. Previously, Presideny Cyril Ramaphosa placed the Health Minister on speacial leave.

The report also said that the company made payments to a company owned by Dedani Mkhize.
