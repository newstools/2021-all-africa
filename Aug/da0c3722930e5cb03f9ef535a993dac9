Two parliament members in Tunisia have been arrested, according to a statement from an opposition party. RFI reports that Maher Zid and Mohamed Affes of the Islamis Al-Karama party have been placed in provisional detention. Al-Karama is allied to the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha party, the main opponent of President Kais Saied.           Earlier, Yassine Ayari, an independent MP, was detained after he criticised the president's decision to suspend parliament and sack the prime minister and other top officials. Rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch expressed concern over the arrest.           The latest arrests fall as the United States called on Tunisia to return swiftly to its "democratic path". A week after his shock move, President Kais Saied has yet to name a new prime minister. He has rejected accusations he staged a "coup" and said he acted within the constitution, which allows the head of state to take unspecified exceptional measures in the event of an "imminent threat". He has also declared a crackdown on corruption, accusing 460 businessmen of embezzlement.           Political commentator Slaheddine Jourchi said the recent arrests were "a strategic mistake" and "not consistent with the president's statements". "Everyone expected him to begin with the dangerous corruption cases and with waging a direct battle against known parties, but these first arrests were of opponents," the analyst said.
