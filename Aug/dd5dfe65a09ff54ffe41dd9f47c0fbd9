The number of adults aged 30-79 years with hypertension has increased from 650 million to 1.28 billion in the last thirty years, according to the first comprehensive global analysis of trends in hypertension prevalence, detection, treatment and control, led by Imperial College London and WHO, and published in The Lancet. Nearly half these people did not know they have the condition. The vast majority of people with high blood pressure, or hypertension, a serious medical condition that significantly increases the risks of heart, brain, kidney and other diseases, reportedly live in low and middle-income countries. Hypertension can be detected easily through measuring blood pressure at home or by a health professional, and can often be treated effectively with medications that are low cost.
