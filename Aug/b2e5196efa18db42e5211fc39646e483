The trial of two Americans accused of murdering a young Namibian man more than 10 years ago in Windhoek, has resumed in the High Court.  The trial of Marcus Thomas and co-accused Kevan Townsend, which started in November 2014, has been moving slowly due to delays on the part of the accused.  These adjournments range from withdrawals of several state-funded defence lawyers who were representing them, to applications for the recusal of the judge as well as Townsend's lawsuit against the government over solitary confinement. The trial was also delayed following an application by Thomas to be declared mentally unfit to stand trial, coupled with his failed attempt to escape from police custody and then the Covid-19 lockdown. Meanwhile, an online campaign under the #Justice4Kevan, which is spearheaded by Townsend's father, Roger Bonds, in an effort to have his son released from police custody, gained traction when American rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs added his voice to it. However Namibians are having none of it  dragging "ignorant" Combs for not doing the necessary research.
