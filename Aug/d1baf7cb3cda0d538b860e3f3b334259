Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has slammed "lazy and ill-disciplined" police for using torture as a means of obtaining confessions from suspects in their custody. Museveni says this derails criminal proceedings during prosecution in courts of law. "Evidence through torture is not reliable. Torture is unnecessary and wrong. It must not be used again, if it has at all being used like I see some groups claim in the media. Confessions by criminals are not necessary if investigators do their work well. You can use facts and circumstantial evidence," the president said. Museveni warned that the ruling National Resistance Movement will not spare those "contaminating the National Resistance Army heritage, image and reputation."
