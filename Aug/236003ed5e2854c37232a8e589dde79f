The country's fight against Covid-19 faces a major hurdle after it emerged that the key antiviral drugs Remdesivir and Actemra are almost out of stock. The acute shortage of the drugs, which are crucial in the treatment of patients with Covid-19 symptoms, comes at a time the country is recording a surge in infections, with more than 1,000 patients in intensive care and the positivity rate at a high of 15%. According to data from the Pharmacy and Poisons Board, there are only 2,000 vials of Remdesivir in the country, spread among a handful of importers, writes Angela Oketch for The Nation. President Uhuru Kenyatta has also extended the ongoing nationwide curfew for a further 60 days, citing escalating Covid-19 infections. He further suspended all physical public gatherings and meetings, including political rallies and campaign meetings for impending by-elections. As of August 20, 2021 Kenya has recorded 225,663 Covid-19 cases with 208,169 recoveries and 4,404 fatalities.
