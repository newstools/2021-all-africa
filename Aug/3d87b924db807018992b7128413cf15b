Rights bodies are raising the alarm over the fate of 3,008 Nigerian convicts on death row as the federal government advises state governors to sign warrants for their execution. The federal government accused the 36 regional state governors of hampering progress and justice because of their failure to sign the death warrants for convicts who are congesting correctional centres.  The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, on July 23 accused the state governors of delaying the wheel of justice and contributing to congestion in correctional centres by refusing to sign the death warrants. Rights groups have argued that the death penalty is "inhumane and outdated." Death warrants were last signed in 2013 in Edo state in south Nigeria for the execution of five condemned prisoners, four of whom were executed by hanging.
