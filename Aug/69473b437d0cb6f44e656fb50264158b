Nigeria is set to conduct a review into animal grazing rights after deadly clashes between herders and farmers who complain about livestock destroying their crops. The review will examine grazing sites in 25 states. A statement by President Muhammadu Buhari's spokesperson, Garba Shehu, said the review will determine the level of encroachment on the grazing sites. The agreement on the number of grazing reserves and states was reached after considering security concerns and other socio-economic conditions. President Buhari approved the rehabilitation of grazing reserves across the country as from June 2021, to curb bloody clashes between herders and farmers. However,  previous government proposals were criticised for favouring the herders, who are mainly from Buhari's ethnic group. Many southern Nigerian states have called for open grazing to be banned, arguing that cattle breeders should set up ranches for their animals.
