The struggle for equality between the sexes is ongoing, although in recent years there has been a closer parity in the opportunities that are afforded to women. Josephine Kimambo and Shadya Jamali are among a few women in the mining industry, forming part of Geita Gold Mining Limited's health and safety department. Both women live by the mantra that "an ordinary life in an extraordinary world is boring and unfulfilled." After successfully completing the programme in 2014, Kimambo, secured employment and took a position as waste and chemical officer, enjoying working at Geita Gold Mining Limited. Kimambo believes that everyone is an author to their story and has the power to make it a positive or negative one. The company has strong non-discrimination policies and values the diversity of its workforce. This enables it to actively invest in initiatives that promote women in the workplace. One of these initiatives is to sponsor women employees to participate in the Female Future Programme, administered by the Association of Tanzania Employers, that prepares them to take up leadership roles within and outside the company.
