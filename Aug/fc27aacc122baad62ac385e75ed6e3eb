A group of senior generals in the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-In Opposition (SPLM-IO) on August 4, 2021 announced they had dismissed Vice President Riek Machar as commander of the group, accusing him of reneging on the movement's vision. Machar allies dismissed the announcement, terming the move as "extreme", and could ruin the peace dividends by splitting the group. The SPLM -IO, itself a splinter group from the ruling party SPLM, also split in 2016. After Riek Machar fled Juba, President Salva Kiir appointed Taban Deng Gai as his replacement, fuelling divisions in the opposition group.           The SPLM-IO generals who announced Machar's ouster, accused him of nepotism, dictatorship, loss of vision, and abandoning SPLA-IO soldiers at the cantonment sites and training centres. SPLA-IO is the military force of SPLM-IO.
