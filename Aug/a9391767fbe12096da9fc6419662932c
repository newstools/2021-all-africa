Cape Verde's Constitutional Court has said in a statement that it has approved seven candidates for the October 17, 2021 presidential elections, and that Péricles Tavares was the only candidate rejected due to some irregularities.           Cape Verde has had four presidents since independence. The leaders were the late Aristides Pereira (1975-1991), the late António Mascarenhas Monteiro (1991-2001), the first by direct election, Pedro Pires (2001-2011) and Jorge Carlos Fonseca (2011 to present). Incumbent Jorge Carlos Fonseca, 70, who has ruled the country since 2011, served the maximum two terms and cannot run in the polls.
