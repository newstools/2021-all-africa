The U.S. Department of State has announced a reward of up to U.S.$5 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Guinea-Bissau national Antonio Indjai.           Indjai is the former head of the Guinea-Bissau Armed Forces and has been the subject of a UN travel ban since May 2012, as a result of his participation in an April 2012 coup d'état in Guinea-Bissau.           Indjai is alleged to have been the leader of a criminal organisation that played an active role in drug trafficking in Guinea Bissau and West Africa for many years, even while serving as head of the Guinea Bissau Armed Forces.           Indjai was seen as one of the most powerful destabilising figures in Guinea-Bissau, operating freely throughout West Africa, using illegal proceeds to corrupt and destabilise other foreign governments and undermine the rule of law throughout the region.
