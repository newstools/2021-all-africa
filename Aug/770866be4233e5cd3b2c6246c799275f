Malawi's Constitutional Court has agreed to hear a challenge to 2020's presidential election rerun from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). President Lazarus Chakwera defeated the DPP's Peter Mutharika in the rerun after the court nullified the 2019 election, which Mutharika had won. The DPP argues the rerun should also be nullified after the High Court quashed the appointment of four DPP commissioners to the Malawi Electoral Commission in June 2021, saying their appointment was invalid and unconstitutional. Mutharika has said he does not recognize the results of the rerun election he lost to Chakwera. Meanwhile, the Constitutional Court has set August 30 to decide whether to proceed with the case and if so, how.
