In May 2021, the hashtag #FixTheCountry and some variations were created on social media by young Ghanaians calling for social and economic reform. The campaign quickly went viral, as thousands joined the protest movement, which also took aim at the government, perceived as having done a bad job. The organisers behind the hashtag - who say they are non-political - called for a street protest on May 9, 2021. They were unable to protest after police obtained an injunction against them, citing safety reasons amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Now the latest protests organised by the group is set to take place on August 4, 2021.           More than half of Ghana's population of 31 million are under 25 years of age. Many cannot afford to go to university. A third of young people are jobless and have no professional training, according to the World Bank. The level of frustration among the youth has increased in line with the hardships brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.
