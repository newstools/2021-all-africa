The health department's official Covid death toll for 2020 was 28,500. But this is less than half the actual Covid death toll for last year, Medical Research Council (MRC) and University of Cape Town (UCT) researchers explain in an article in the South African Medical Journal. The official data, by and large, only include confirmed Covid deaths in hospitals. The MRC/UCT research shows that the number of actual Covid deaths is probably more than double this. There is great variation across provinces. Covid deaths were underestimated the least in the Western Cape and most in Northern Cape and North-West. Depending on definition, between 70,000 and 76,000 excess deaths occurred in 2020 over the months of the Covid-19 epidemic. By comparison, there were an estimated 73,500 deaths due to HIV/AIDS in 2020 in South Africa. In the absence of the pandemic, HIV/AIDS would have been the leading single cause of death. As of August 12, 2021, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in South Africa total 2,554,240, of which 75,774 proved fatal and 2,337,591 resulted in recovery.
