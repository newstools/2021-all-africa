Following a report  in June 2021 of sexual abuse in the U-18 women's national basketball team, the coach Amadou Bamba was arrested and charged on July 26, 2021. He is in jail awaiting trial on charges of  "pedophilia, attempted rape, and molestation." Since 2016, Bamba is reported to have sexually assaulted or harassed at least three players and thwarted their careers when they refused to have sex with him, survivors, parents, and witnesses told Human Rights Watch. His arrest is an important step in protecting children and women athletes from abuse, Human Rights Watch has said.
