The government may invoke provisions of the Constitution to resolve differences between the Senate and the National Assembly over the Marriages Amendment Bill if a solution is not found by the end of the current Parliamentary session, legislators have been told. The Bill sailed through the National Assembly in 2020, but since then, it has been stalled in Senate after disagreements emerged between the government and traditional leaders, on a clause related to the payment of lobola.  Debate on the Bill resumed in April, 2021 but there was no headway in finding common ground on Clause 16 which provides that payment of lobola could not be regarded as a barrier in solemnising marriage between two consenting adults if they satisfy other requirements of the law. This has not gone down well with traditional leaders who argue that payment of bride price was a hallmark of marriage in customary unions.
