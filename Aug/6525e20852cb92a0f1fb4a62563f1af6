Reports from Senegalese media say former Chadian President Hissène Habré has died. He reportedly died on August 24, 2021, after complications caused by the novel coronavirus, Covid-19. Though sentenced to life in Dakar for crimes against humanity committed during his term as president in Chad, the former Chadian president was able to benefit from a 60-day prison release, during the first wave of Covid-19. This move granted to him by Senegalese judicial system due to the Covid-19 pandemic had aroused the ire of the organization of the victims of the massacres that occurred in Chad during Habré's reign, as well as human rights organizations. Habré was however denied a second exemption during the third wave of the novel coronavirus.
