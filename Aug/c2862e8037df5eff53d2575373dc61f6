Amid the imminent third wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic and the recent outbreak of cholera in more than 13 states, Nigerian doctors have announced the commencement of a nationwide industrial action from August 2, 2021. The doctors, members of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), blamed the government for the strike, calling on its members to resume an "indefinite and total strike" to press home its demand for better welfare packages - part of an agreement signed with the government in April, 2021. The doctors had demanded, amongst other things, the immediate payment of Covid-19 inducement allowance to some of their members in federal and state tertiary institutions. The doctors had downed tools several times over these same issues. The doctor's strike is coming at a time the country is preparing for a possible third wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Nigeria has continued to witness a consistent increase in the number of cases and deaths, including the presence of the Delta variant which is already present in many parts of the country. Reports of cholera outbreaks in various states including Bauchi, Enugu, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Plateau, Benue, Bayelsa, Delta, among others, have already added to the pressure on the nation's health facilities. The country has over one million people vaccinated. Nigeria has recorded at least 174,315 confirmed Covid-19 cases, 165,015 recoveries, and over 2,149 fatalities. Meanwhile, an outbreak of Cholera has killed 325 people in 15 states between January and June, 2021, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has said.
