The Zimbabwe government has approved the reopening of schools from August 30, while restaurants can reopen but only allowing fully vaccinated people to eat in. Addressing journalists, Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said schools will reopen starting with examination classes, while inter-city travel has also resumed. Zimbabwe is also opening Covid-19 vaccinations to those aged 14 and older as a devastating wave of the disease recedes. The country is already offering shots to those 18 and older making it one of the first countries in Africa to extend vaccinations to children. The southern African country is beginning to see a reduction in numbers of infections and deaths following a deadly resurgence, driven mainly by the delta variant.
