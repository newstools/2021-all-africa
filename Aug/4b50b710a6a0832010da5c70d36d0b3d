The delayed 2020 Paralympics starts today, August 24 until September 5, 2021 in Tokyo. Africa is pulling out all the stops to return to winning ways and make amends for a generally poor showing at Tokyo Olympics 2020. Kenya, Nigeria, Angola and South Africa are among the African teams participating. The Paralympics logo - Agitos - meaning "I move" in Latin - symbolises the core values of the Paralympics - courage, determination, inspiration and equality - the colours red, blue and green were chosen as they are those most used in the flags of the world.  Both the Paralympics and the Olympics compete in parallel sporting codes that include among others, archery, athletics, canoe sprints, cycling, equestrian, football, judo and powerlifting.
