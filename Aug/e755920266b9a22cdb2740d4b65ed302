Kenya will soon ban fish imports from China as it has enough fish stocks in its lakes, rivers and the ocean, the national assembly's agriculture committee has confirmed. MPs and fishery officials were on a fact-finding mission on the plight of fishermen in the Coast region in July 2021. They said they want to help the country harness the sector's potential and create job and business opportunities. In February 2021, Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya said Kenya's deep waters are being exploited by foreign industrial fishing vessels because local fishermen cannot work in those waters. Artisanal fishermen have limited fishing technology for semi-industrial and industrial fisheries in deep waters and Kenya can licence up to 70 fishing vessels in its deep sea, according to Munya.
