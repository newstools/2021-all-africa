The committee on Labour and Social welfare has backed the Children (Amendment) Bill, 2020 by Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma, which seeks to have the rights of all children applied uniformly, whether their parents are married or not, by aligning the principal law with Article 53 of the Constitution which provides that every child has a right to parental care and protection. Currently, the law is not uniform as it applies differently to children whose parents are married and those with single parents. For instance, section 24 (3) of the law, which the Bill wants amended, provides that where a child's father and mother are not married to each other, the mother shall have parental responsibility at the first instance. Other MPs have also backed this Child Amendment Bill in what could mark a big win for men who, as per the current law, are disadvantaged in the event of separation or divorce.
