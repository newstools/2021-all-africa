Opposition party ActionSA has called on people and businesses affected by looting and violence  to share their experiences as part of a groundbreaking class-action lawsuit against the rulting African National Congress (ANC). Party leader Herman Mashaba said: "President Ramaphosa, Minister Cele, and the rest of the Executive were, and remain, under a positive legal duty to uphold and maintain law and order by taking proactive steps to protect and preserve the rule of law ... In addition to this action, we have also demanded that the President establish an independent Judicial Commission of Inquir .... We believe such an inquiry would have the necessary power to hold even members of Cabinet to account whilst preventing the ANC from using its majority in Parliament to whitewash any meaningful investigation and cover up the tracks of the many instigators who are quite likely their senior members and benefactors." Violence erupted when former president Jacob Zuma began serving a 15-month jail sentence for contempt of court over failing to appear before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into state capture. Looters vandalised shopping malls, other retail outlets, businesses, factories and infrastructure with over 1,000 people arrested as a result.
