Zambians voted in general elections on August 12, 2021 after a tense campaign dominated by economic woes, a debt crisis and the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic. There are 16 presidential candidates, but the frontrunners are incumbent Edgar Lungu and long-time rival Hakainde Hichilema. Voters also cast their ballots for members of parliament and district council leaders. Voice of America's Peter Clottey, who is in the capital city Lusaka, said voter participation was high. He said election observers has reported no problems with voting.           The winning candidate must acquire more than 50% of the vote to win outright. Analysts say a runoff, which would be within 37 days of the first round, is unlikely. Polls closed at 6pm local time at more than 12,000 voting stations spread across the country. Official results are expected by August 15, 2021.
