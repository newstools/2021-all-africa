Princess, Arin, Tega, Saskay, Emmanuel and Nini are up for possible eviction on August 15, 2021. Head of House Pere used his Veto Power to save Saga, replacing him with Saskay. In a surprising twist on the last eviction show, Big Brother added another four new housemates - Michael, Kayvee, JMK, and Queen, who cannot be nominated for eviction this time round. Twenty-three housemates are competing for the grand prize, which will see the winner walk away with U.S.$236,000 worth of prizes - the highest in the show's history.
