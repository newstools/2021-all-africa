President Salva Kiir has called for a ceasefire between factions of Sudan People's Liberation Movement-In Opposition (SPLM-IO) and work toward peace. At a press conference in capital Juba, Tut Gatlauk, the president's adviser on national security, said a committee has been formed to investigate the root causes of the division. "After we signed the 2018 peace agreement, we don't need to lose more lives to civil war. Now, we are moving towards unifying the forces but we are concerned by the declaration and fighting that took place in the Magenis area," he said.           The president's ceasfire call came after some SPLA-IO soldiers loyal to Dr Riek Machar and those loyal to Machar's former army chief Lt Gen Gatwech Dual, clashed in Meganis on August 14-15, 2021. The SPLM-IO generals ostensibly replaced Machar with his previous army chief Simon Gatwech Dual with immediate effect. Dr Machar's political bureau condemned the move and described the generals behind the plan as "peace spoilers".
