Lamu fishers, especially on the northern shores of the Indian Ocean, from Kiwayu to Kipungani and Mpeketoni on the Tana River County boundary, are complaining that trawlers believed to be from China, Spain and South Korea have been spotted operating illegally in shallow waters at night. The fishermen have said that the ships are destroying their fishing gear and damaging the sea floor and coral reefs. They added that trawlers are not sticking to designated areas. Areas such as Pezali, Pate, Mwamba wa Hasssan, Mwamba wa Yeye, Ziwayu, Zinyika, Kizingitini, Tenewi and Kipungani were the most affected by destructive trawler activities, they said.  Lamu Deputy Governor, Abdulhakim Aboud, has urged the national government to work closely with county governments to curb illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in Kenyan territorial waters.
