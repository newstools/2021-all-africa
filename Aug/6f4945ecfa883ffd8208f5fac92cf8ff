The backdrop to the current Zambian election cycle is far from an environment conducive to debating solutions for the serious challenges Zambians face, writes Michelle Gavin for the Council on Foreign Relations. The stage being set for next month's Zambian elections looks worryingly like a case study in ongoing democratic decline. Polls slated for August 12 will elect the country's next president and members of its National Assembly. They will feature a tight contest between incumbent Edgar Lungu and his ruling Patriotic Front versus opposition stalwart Hakainde Hichilema of the United Party for National Development. The issues that should be animating the campaign are serious; Zambians have experienced worsening poverty and inequality in recent years, the country confronts staggering foreign debt, and high-profile scandals have contributed to perceptions of worsening corruption. A third wave of Covid-19 hit the weary country hard last month and continues to keep Zambian children out of school.
