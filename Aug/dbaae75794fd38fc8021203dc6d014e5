Turkana County is on high alert over fears of a surge in tuberculosis (TB) infections, which officials say could hit 2,500 cases in a year. The county has stepped up the war against TB with more testing kits that will be strategically installed in remote health centres. TB is a potentially serious infectious bacterial disease that mainly affects the lungs. It is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is the fifth leading cause of death in Kenya, claiming 53,000 lives each year. With nearly 2.5 million suffering from the disease and more than 660,000 dying in 2019 in sub-Saharan Africa, Kenya, in its national strategic plan to curb the disease, wants to cure at least 597,000 cases by 2023, writes Sammy Lutta for The Nation.
