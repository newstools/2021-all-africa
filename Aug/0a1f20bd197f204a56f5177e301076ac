Pere, Maria, Queen, Sammie, Cross, and JMK, have been nominated for eviction in week five of the Big Brother Naija Shine Ya Eye season. Head of House (HOH) Liquorose, used his veto power to save Peace, voting for Cross instead. At least, one of the housemates will be evicted from the reality show on August 29, 2021. Meanwhile, JMK, Pere and Maria, have been issued a strike each for microphone infringement in the house. Big Brother played a video that showed Maria and Pere removing their microphones- which is against the BBNaija rules. JMK meanwhile wore hers in the jacuzzi during the party on August 20, 2021! The trio have now been banned from playing the HOH games for two weeks. The Season 6 winner will walk away with U.S.$236,000 in prizes - the highest in the show's history.
