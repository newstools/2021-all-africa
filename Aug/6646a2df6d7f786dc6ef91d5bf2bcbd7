An expert has warned that when, and if, international forces try to hand over security to the Somali government, the world could see a repeat of what happened in Afghanistan, where the Taliban seized power once the U.S. forces withdrew.             In April 2021 Somali armed forces assumed a lead role in their operations, as laid out in a Somalia Transition Plan approved by the government and the African Union Mission in Somalia, AMISOM.           The plan is a strategy in which AMISOM peacekeepers will gradually transfer security responsibilities to Somali security agencies before a pullout. The plan signed in 2018, includes a troop reduction.           Former Somali intelligence official Abdulsalam Gulaid says Somalia could see a similar development to Afghanistan, unless the Somali government ends its over-dependence on international troops. Gulaid spoke a day after pro-Al-Shabaab media outlets in Somalia celebrated the fall of Afghanistan's government to the Taliban on August 15, 2021.
