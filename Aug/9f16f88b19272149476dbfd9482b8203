The legal team for former president Jacob Zuma has called on the Constitutional Court judges not to let "pride" and "pettiness" deter them from considering the former leader's rights. Zuma's defence argues that the court violated his right to a fair trial and that international law requires the judges allow him a full criminal trial before sentencing him. Zuma's team added that by undoing its initial decision to incarcerate him, the court would be performing a "courageous act". "The Constitutional Court must also accept, as other judges in comparative jurisdictions, that like the rest of mankind, they may be affected from time to time by pride, passion, by pettiness and bruised feelings, by improper understanding or by excessive zeal," a statement read. This comes after the former president underwent surgery for an undisclosed condition. Zuma's hospitalisation came ahead of a scheduled appearance before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, a body created to investigate alleged corruption among government officials and private individuals. Zuma was sentenced to a 15-month jail term on June 29, 2021 after he refused to testify before the commission. His incarceration sparked riots and unrest in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. Cyril Ramaphosa's appearance before the commission - which marked the end of the three-year long inquiry - saw the president confirm his awareness of graft in the ruling African National Congress. He offered assurance that work was being done to remedy it.
