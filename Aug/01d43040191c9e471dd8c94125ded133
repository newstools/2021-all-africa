Gbolahan Ololade, popularly known as Kayvee, has withdrawn from the reality show due to health concerns. His withdrawal came after much speculation among fellow housemates and viewers that all might not be well with him. Kayvee was one of the four new housemates introduced two weeks after the show started. Prior to his exit, he consulted with Big Brother and the on-site medical team, where it was decided that he had to leave the house for a more thorough medical investigation. The remaining housemates were asked to pack his bags and other personal belongings and move them into the storeroom.
