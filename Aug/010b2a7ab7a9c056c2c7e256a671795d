Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has been working with Member States and the scientific community to better understand how this pandemic began so that we can be better prepared for the next one. Following the publication of the WHO-China joint report of the phase one studies on the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in March 2021, WHO has outlined the next series of studies that need to be undertaken and continues to be in discussions with Member States and experts on next steps. To move forward, WHO calls for all governments to depoliticize the situation and cooperate to accelerate the origins studies, and importantly to work together to develop a common framework for future emerging pathogens of pandemic potential. As of August 17, confirmed cases of Covid-19 from 55 African countries reached 7,296,720 while over 55,904,582 vaccinations have been administered across the continent.
