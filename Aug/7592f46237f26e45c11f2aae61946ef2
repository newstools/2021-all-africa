After more than two years in a South African jail, the country will hand Mozambique's former finance minister Manuel Chang over to authorities in Maputo. The Ministry of Justice and Correctional Services said in a statement that Chang would be extradited to Maputo where he will face charges linked to Mozambique's largest corruption scandal in history. Chang is accused of signing off on guarantees that led to the so-called hidden debt scandal, partly authorising loans of over U.S.$2 billion between 2013 and 2014. Chang, who denies wrongdoing, has been in custody in South Africa since 2018 while the government debated whether to send him back to Mozambique or to the U.S. The U.S. had also requested his extradition to face charges for his role in the matter, where his accomplices have already stood trial and were sentenced. Meanwhile, anti-corruption watchdogs believe he will escape justice in Mozambique and should be sent to face trial in the U.S. instead. Mozambican anti-corruption watchdogs are scrambling to try to stop South Africa from extraditing Chang to Mozambique to face fraud, corruption, and money laundering charges.
