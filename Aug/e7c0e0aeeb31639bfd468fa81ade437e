Amnesty International, a global human rights group, has said that the failure of the Nigerian authorities to live up to their obligation to protect the right to life has enabled a month of bloody attacks on both farmers and herders in some parts of Kaduna and Plateau States.  At least 112 people were killed, 160 abducted and thousands displaced in communities in Kaduna and Plateau states from July to August 5, 2021.  "Our findings show that despite clear signs that there will be retaliatory attacks, enough is not being done to prevent the bloodshed, thereby fueling the ongoing circle of violence. Beyond issuing statements and condemning attacks after they happen; government needs to rein in on attackers and bring suspects to justice," said Amnesty's Nigeria Director, Osai Ojigho. The rights group's investigation also shows that at least 78 people were killed and 160 abducted between July 3 and August 5, 2021 in Kaduna State, including 121 schoolchildren who were taken from Bethel Baptist Church High School. Villagers from farming communities informed Amnesty International that innocent people and communities that know nothing about the attacks are sometimes targeted for reprisal. The group added: "At least 34 people have been killed in Plateau State, including seven herders who were attacked on July 1, 2021 at Dogon Gaba. Abductions have become rampant in many parts of Nigeria. The northern part of the country has increasingly become a hub for large criminal gangs who raid villages, killing and abducting residents after looting and torching homes. More than 700 children and students have already been kidnapped by gunmen for ransom since December 2020. Some have been freed, while others remain missing.
