A recent report by The New Humanitarian found that eight internally displaced persons (IDPs) have been coerced into sex with community leaders, who also demand money in exchange for food aid in the Centre North region. IDPs are saying that they do not receive food aid from the state or non-profits.            One woman, said she has been forced to take desperate measures after living in shelters for six months without much to eat, unless she had sex with people distributing food.           A local official from a town with a large IDP population, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Voice of America that the size of the sex-for-food scandal is likely much bigger than has been reported so far.
