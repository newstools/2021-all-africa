Burkina Faso's President Marc Christian Kaboré has declared three days of national mourning after suspected militants killed 47 people, including 30 civilians, in the latest attack in the north of the country. The area is in the notorious "three-border" zone where Burkina Faso meets Mali and Niger, a focus of the militia in the broader Sahel region of West Africa.           It was the third major attack on Burkinabe soldiers in the past two weeks. The attack on August 2, 2021 near the Niger border, killed 30 people, including 11 civilians. The country has since 2015 been battling increasingly frequent and deadly attacks by militia affiliated with Islamic State and Al-Qaeda.
