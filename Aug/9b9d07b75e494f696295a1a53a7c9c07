South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's long-awaited Cabinet reconfiguration was extensive, with a strong focus on dismantling the security cluster and bringing it closer to him personally, writes Carien du Plessis for the Daily Maverick. In a televised address to the nation, the president said the government's three priority areas were rolling out Covid-19 vaccinations, rebuilding the economy and restoring peace and stability. Du Plessis reports that it was the latter that saw the most radical changes - signalling the depth of his disappointment in the failure of the security forces to prevent the wide-scale looting and destruction that took place in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces three weeks ago. While Bheki Cele survived as police minister, the other two security ministers are out and Ramaphosa has taken responsibility for state security into his Cabinet.           Before the address, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize and Finance Minister Tito Mboweni announced their resignations. Mkhize is embroiled in a corruption scandal, while Mboweni has long wanted to retire from his post. Mkhize has been replaced by Dr Joe Phaahla, who has been Deputy Minister of Health since 2019. Mboweni's portfolio has been taken by Enoch Godongwana, who was Deputy Minister of Public Enterprises (2009-2010) and Deputy Minister of Economic Development till 2012.
