Former prime minister Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga has been arrested as part of a corruption investigation. Further arrests are expected in the anti-graft drive led by Mali's Supreme Court.           Maiga is being questioned in connection with the allegedly fraudulent purchase of a presidential plane in 2014, when he was serving as defence minister. Former finance minister Bouaré Fily Sissoko has also been arrested on corruption charges.           Maiga announced recently that he had been cleared of involvement in the matter. However, Supreme Court Prosecutor Mamadou Timbo contradicted the former prime minister, saying in a television interview that Maiga is still a person of interest.
