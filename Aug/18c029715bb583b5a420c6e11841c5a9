Nigeria has sponsored or co-sponsored six satellites, of which only two are currently operational. One of them is functioning even though it has passed its expiry date, according to Dr Halilu Shaba Ahmad, the director general of the National Space Research and Development Agency. Space Policy Researcher Samuel Oyewole has said that currently, Nigeria has a communication satellite, NigComSat-1R, and an Earth observation satellite, NigeriaSat-2, in operation. The communication satellite was designed to last for 15 years (2011-2026) in orbit. The Earth observation satellite is surviving beyond the projected life expectancy of seven years (2011-2018). If NigeriaSat-2 goes down without a replacement, it will affect Nigeria's capacity to access space support for development and security as the satellite provides information on security, agriculture, and transportation. Aside from satellite-generated data, the Nigerian government has limited capacity to determine things like agricultural and construction activities across the country in almost real-time. Nigeria has been hit by kidnapping, banditry, communal clashes, attacks on government facilities, and killings. Despite efforts by security agencies to control the situation, the security threats remain potent, Oyewole told The Conversation West Africa's Adejuwon Soyinka.
