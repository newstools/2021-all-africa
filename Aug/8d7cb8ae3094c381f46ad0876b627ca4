Paul Gicheru, a lawyer who is accused of bribery and corruptly influencing witnesses who were to give evidence against Deputy President William Ruto at the ICC has said he is "uncomfortable" with being tried by Judge Miatta Maria Samba. He says his checks on the background of the judge have established that she was previously employed by the International Criminal Court's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) between 2006 and 2010. The judge, he says, may have assisted with or been involved in the OTP's investigations in the various Kenyan cases. The OTP was then under prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo. The lawyer fears that the judge may have forehand information about the case facing him, due to her involvement in the Kenya investigations and the contacts she may have had with witnesses and investigators in the case, writes Joseph Wangui for The Nation.
