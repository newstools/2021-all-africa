A group calling itself the People's Coalition for Civil Action is organising a protest after launching a public campaign for change in July 2021. It says the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity led by President Salva Kiir is doing very little to address the many challenges facing the people.           The country's police service spokesperson Major-General Daniel Justin, has invited protest organisers to meet with the police, saying the planned protests will "cause public disorder and will not be tolerated by authorities".           A heavy police presence could be seen along several streets in Juba on August 27, 2021. "Officers have orders to arrest anyone who takes to the streets to participate in the protests", Justin said.
