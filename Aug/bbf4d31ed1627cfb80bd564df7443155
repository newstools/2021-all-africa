Kilishi, a local meat delicacy requiring the use of firewood for its preparation, is becoming unsustainable and less profitable as deforestation progresses and charcoal becomes scarcer. The solar-powered factory has led to a cut in production time from an average of 3-4 days to 3 hours (at peak sunshine); an increase in production capacity - 1,600 kg of meat (about the amount of beef from 8 cows) can now be processed per day. The same quantity would take 20 Kilishi makers 2 weeks using the traditional sun-drying method. While production was barely sufficient for domestic consumption earlier, Kilishi is now being exported to customers in Kano, Abuja, and Lagos, while other states like Kaduna, Zamfara, and Adamawa have expressed interest in placing orders. Processing and drying Kilishi in solar-drying domes eliminates the drudgery of doing so in the open air with the constant threat of rain, whirlwinds, flies, and birds contaminating the meat. The improved hygiene and taste of the solar-powered Kilishi have also increased its market value. In addition to conserving firewood, the factory is demonstrating the potential for job creation for youth who would have otherwise migrated to cities in other states.
