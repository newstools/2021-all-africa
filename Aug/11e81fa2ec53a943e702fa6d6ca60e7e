Algeria has severed diplomatic relations with Morocco, accusing its neighbour of using Pegasus spyware against Algerian officials, having a hand in deadly wildfires and failing in its bilateral commitments.           Algeria's High Security Council, chaired by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, accused Morocco of involvement in wildfires that ravaged northern Algeria, killing 90 people. Algeria has blamed the fires on militants who are backed by Morocco.           The disputed territory of Western Sahara has also stirred tensions over the summer. Algeria supports Polisario Front fighters seeking independence for the desert terrain, which is claimed by Morocco. Algeria, meanwhile, claims Morocco is providing support to the MAK separatist group that is looking for independence for the Kabylie region.           Despite this diplomatic breakdown, Morocco has said it would remain a "credible and loyal partner" to the Algerian people.
