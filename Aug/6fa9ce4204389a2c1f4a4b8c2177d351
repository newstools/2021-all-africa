The last time Nigeria reported a novel antimicrobial compound of microbial origin was in 1986, under a project commissioned by Pfizer. The compound was used to treat coccidiosis in poultry and to promote growth in pigs. It was the second such compound from Nigeria, but research stalled in the decades that followed. While work continued on the potential of microorganisms as antibiotic producers, no novel compound was reported. The question became where to look next. Previous environmental clean-up research suggested a way of filling the gap: using fungi found in waste produced by chemical industries, writes Sunday Omeike for The Conversation. Sango-Ota, Ogun State's industrial city, southwest Nigeria, is home to many industries, including producers of chemicals. Reseachers explored the waste (sludge) from these companies, looking for fungi with potential to produce antibiotics. They found six species that showed some promise. According to Dr Omeike, a lecturer in Industrial Microbiology at McPherson University in Nigeria, the discovery of a new antibiotic compound in a Nigerian environment is good news for researchers in this field. "The next step could be to try to improve the compound we found. Instead, we recommend exploring other modified or specialised environments for isolates with possible antibiotic action against some of the deadliest disease-causing bacteria", he said.
