Newly elected President Hakainde Hichilema fired Zambia Police Service Inspector General Kakoma Kanganja and all service chiefs and their deputies barely a week after his inauguration. Hichilema announced the appointment of new army and airforce chiefs, as well as a new head of the southern African country's defence wing. "I am relieving all commissioners of police with immediate effect," he said, without providing reasons for the replacements, in a televised address to the nation. Hichilema, 59, took office on August 24, 2021, after his landslide victory against incumbent Edgar Lungu. He won with over 60% of the vote and is seen as the electorate's reaction to the incumbent's economic mismanagement and the authoritarian leadership in the southern African country.
