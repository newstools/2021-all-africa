Tanzania's ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), on August 11, 2021 banned its Swahili tabloid Uhuru for 14 days, for publishing false information that said President Samia Suluhu Hassan would not be participating in the next general election in 2025. The Office of the Director of Information Services said it found that the news had both legal and professional gaps and was contrary to Section 50 (I) (a), (b) and (d) and Section 52 (d) and (e) of the Information Services Act No.12 of 2016. The newspaper's board has acted by suspending three editors of the newspaper, and formed a special committee to probe the matter. The CCM Secretary-General Daniel Chongolo has apologised to President Suluhu Hassan.
