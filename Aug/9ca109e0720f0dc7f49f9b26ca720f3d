The Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture Series has invited prominent people to drive debate on significant social issues. The lecture series is an important event on the Nelson Mandela Foundation's calendar, and encourages people to enter into dialogue - often about difficult subjects - in order to address the challenges we face today. The 19th Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture was delivered by former International Criminal Court prosecutor Fatou Bensouda who called for greater cooperation between states and institutions to address justice, and who lamented the level of greed and impunity by those in power across the continent that limits progress made towards ensuring peace.
