Africa's health ministers have met to take stock of the continent's fight against Covid-19 as the pandemic continues to stretch health systems to breaking point in some countries and just 2% of all Africans are fully vaccinated against the virus. Ministers assessed immediate actions needed to curb Africa's third wave, which saw Covid-19 cases in Africa surpass 7 million, reach a record weekly peak of over 250,000 in early July and drive up deaths to a record weekly peak of over 6,400 in early August. The third wave has declined over the last five weeks since the peak in early July, but 16 countries are still experiencing a surge in new cases. As of August 25, 2021, the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the continent totalled 7,592,704 of which 190,872 proved fatal and 6,698,200 resulted in recovery.
