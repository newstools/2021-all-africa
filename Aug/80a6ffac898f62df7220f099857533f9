After a very disappointing alround showing from Africa at the Tokyo Olympics 2020, the focus now turns to the 2021 World Athletics U20 Championships, also known as the World Junior Championships. It is an international competition for athletes qualifying as juniors, born no earlier than January 1, 2002. It is taking place from August 17 to 22, 2021 at the Nyayo Sports Complex in Nairobi. Over the five days, 119 countries will participate in 44 events. Big plans are afoot for those athletes competing, with the Kenyan government committing to place their athletes on a special training programme after the event, with an eye on preparation for the Paris Olympics in 2024. The Nigeria team has a number of athletes representing their country for the first time. A total of 32 athletes, including 17 men and 15 women have been selected for sprint event, relays and some field events. South Africa, whose senior team only bagged three medals at the Tokyo Olympics, will rely heavily on their juniors to set the track and field alight. Heavyweights such as the U.S., Britain, Germany and Australia will not participate at these championships.
