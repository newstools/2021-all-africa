Recently published research has revealed that the new Covid-19 variant C.1.2 has been identified in South Africa. According to the researchers, there are concerns that this SARS-CoV-2 variant of interest (VOI) has been associated with increased transmissibility, neutralisation resistance, and disease severity. "Here we report the identification of a potential variant of interest assigned to the Pango Lineage C.1.2," the preprint analysis read. The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention defines a VOI as a variant where there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease, which may lead to hospitalisation, or death. According to the U.S. epidemiologist and health economist, Dr Eric Feigl-Ding, this new variant has somehow mutated so fast and far that it is now the furthest mutated variant found to date. "This C.1.2 is obviously a very fast-moving variant. We don't know the exact transmission yet or the severity or vaccine efficacy yet. But the best advice that will serve us well is to take the precautionary principles as the approach - move fast," he tweeted. As of August 30, 2021 South Africa has confirmed 2,764,931 cases of Covid-19 of which 81,595 proved fatal and 2,526,199 resulted in recovery. "This C.1.2 is obviously a very fast-moving variant.
