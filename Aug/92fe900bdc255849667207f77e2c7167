Another iconic lion was killed by an American hunter using a bow and arrow in the giant Hwange National Park, sparking global outrage.           The lion named Mopane, believed to be 12 years old, was reportedly lured out of the park using bait, into nearby land before he was killed. The lion is the second well-known Zimbabwean lion killed by a foreign big game hunter, just metres from where Cecil the lion was killed by an American dentist in 2015.           Around 20,000 adult lions live in the wild in Africa and according to the Worldwide Fund for Nature, the species is classified as "vulnerable".
