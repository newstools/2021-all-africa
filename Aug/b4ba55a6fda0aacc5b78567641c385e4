The game has officially begun as Beatrice, Yerins, Whitemoney, Yousef, and Niyi were put up for possible eviction. The Head of House Boma, who had veto power to replace any housemate up for eviction, saved Jay Paul and put up Yousef for eviction. At the beginning of the show, Biggie informed the housemates that they were two "Wild Card" housemates. He gave them the task to find out who they were, adding that if they guessed correctly, the Wild Cards would be evicted immediately, but if otherwise, the Wild Cards would remain and compete with the rest of them. Maria and Pere were later unveiled as the Wild Cards but the housemates are yet to find out and they have remained on the show. The Wild Cards were given the exclusive power of nominating four housemates for eviction. Twenty-two housemates are competing for the grand prize. The winner will walk away with U.S.$236,000 worth of prizes - the highest in the show's history.
