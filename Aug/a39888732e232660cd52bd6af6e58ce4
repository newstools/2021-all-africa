Severe droughts and floods have had a devastating impact on Madagascar's rural poor, who are reliant on small-scale farming or fishing. Water levels are rising each year and weather patterns are becoming more unusual and extreme. Madagascar is one of the countries most exposed to cyclones in Africa. Climate change is expected to bring stronger cyclones and further droughts, which will have a dramatic impact on food security and infrastructure in a country where about 90% of the population already lives on less than U.S.$3 a day. Issa Sanogo, the UN Resident Coordinator in Madagascar, visited south of Madagascar, known as the Grand Sud, where hundreds of thousands of people are suffering from one of the worst droughts in the region in 40 years. Sanongo, the most senior UN official in the country, has said that the population is facing a severe humanitarian crisis.
