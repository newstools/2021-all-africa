A recruitment agency based in Nigeria's capital Abuja, is conducting interviews with doctors wanting to leave Nigeria, to work in Saudi Arabia. At least 500 doctors in Abuja turned up at the recruitment offices, according to Daily Trust.  Doctors have said that poor remuneration, inadequate manpower, poor health facilities and equipment, and insecurity are some of the reasons making them seek greener pastures abroad. Experts however warn that the mass exodus of doctors poses a threat to the country's already weak health system and shortage of healthcare professionals. Meanwhile, the doctors' strike is raising concerns as Nigeria confronts a third wave of the novel coronavirus, triggered by the Delta variant.  The country has seen an upsurge in the number of Covid-19 cases, with Lagos State still the epicentre of the pandemic with 71,133 cases and 471 deaths. The country has over one million people vaccinated.  Nigeria has recorded at least 188,243 confirmed Covid-19 cases, 169,035 recoveries, and over 2,281 fatalities.
