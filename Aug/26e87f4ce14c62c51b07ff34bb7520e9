South Africa's energy policy is managed through the Integrated Resource Plan. The document is prepared by a panel of experts and sets out the preferred evolution of the power generation landscape, writes Hartmut Winkler for The Conversation. These plans are supposed to be reformulated every two years. A major obstacle facing the nation is that of power generation and electricity supply programmes. National power utility Eskom has been unable to provide a steady power supply due to ageing infrastructure and an abnormally high number of breakdowns. This has led to periodic electricity blackouts at times when demand has exceeded supply. South Africa needs a detailed and thoroughly researched set of scenarios mapped out to inform a new electricity plan.
