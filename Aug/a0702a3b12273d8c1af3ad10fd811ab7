The United Nations is warning that global hunger is increasing and that urgent action is needed to stave off famine and death over the coming months in nearly two dozen unstable, violence-prone countries. A report by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP) says that more than a half-million people are experiencing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity, while 41 million people are at risk of famine. The 23 hotspots identified are in Africa - Angola, Central Africa Republic, Central Sahel, Chad, DR Congo, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Nigeria, Liberia and South Sudan. In the Middle East - Afghanistan, Lebanon, Syrian Arab Republic, Yemen. In South America - El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Colombia. In Asia - Myanmmar, Carribean - Haiti. In 2020, 155 million people faced acute food insecurity at crisis or worse levels in 55 countries, according to the Global Report on Food Crises. The report highlights that conflict, climate extremes, and economic shocks, often related to the economic fallout of Covid-19, are likely to remain primary drivers of acute food insecurity for the August-November period in 2021.
