A recent assessment by climatologists at the Global Change Institute (GCI) at the University of the Witwatersrand has indicated an increasing likelihood that the taps in Gauteng are going to run dry sometime in the 2030s or the 2040s if global heating continues unabated, writes Ethan Van Diemen for Daily Maverick. This comes after the release of the The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report Six Working Group I report described that climate change is widespread, rapid, intensifying and unprecedented in thousands of years in what it said was a 'code red' for humanity. Professor Francois Engelbrecht, Professor of Climatology at the Wits Global Change Institute and a lead author on that recent Working Group 1 report of the IPCC, said: "I think that the single biggest risk we are facing because of climate change in the immediate future - by that I mean the next 10 years - is a Day Zero drought in Gauteng." Day Zero relates to the Cape Town water crisis during a period of severe water shortage in the Western Cape region which peaked between mid-2017 to mid-2018 when water levels hovered between 15 and 30% of total dam capacity, a scenario that may reoccur. The IPCC has previously identified the 1.5°C global average temperature increase as a tipping point in the climate crisis. It says that, after reaching this tipping point, we can expect "warming of extreme temperatures ... frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation ... and an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts".
