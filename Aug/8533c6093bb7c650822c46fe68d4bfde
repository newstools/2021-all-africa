Two dozen teams will discover their fate on August 17, 2021 as the Yaounde Conference Centre in the draw for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.           Originally scheduled for June and July 2021, the Confederation of African Football (CAF), which organises the event, said in January 2020 that it would be played in January and February of 2021. However in June 2020, CAF moved the competition to January 2022 due to the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic.           Hosts Cameroon and defending champions Algeria will be in pot one with the 2019 finalists Senegal as well as Tunisia, Nigeria and Morocco.      Egypt, Ghana, Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea and Burkina Faso will comprise pot two while Mauritania feature in pot three with Cape Verde, Gabon, Zimbabwe, Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone.           As in the 2019 tournament in Egypt, the top two from the six groups will advance directly to the last-16 with the four best third-placed teams.           From there, the competition becomes a knockout tournament with penalties to decide the winner of a tie if the score is level after 30 minutes of extra-time.
