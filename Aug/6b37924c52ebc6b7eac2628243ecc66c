A warehouse storing chemicals was set ablaze during recent looting, poisoning a nearby estuary and strangling incomes of fishermen already crimped by repeated Covid-19 lockdowns, writes Kim Harrisberg for the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The Indian-owned toxic chemical plant was part of a special 'fast-track' economic investment scheme by national government, with no specific environmental or hazardous substance approvals or any local government scrutiny. "I have never seen a thing like this," said 76-year-old Pillay from his home in Phoenix, a town north of central Durban that was badly hit by July's riots. "This is devastating for us, on top of lockdown, this just adds fuel to the fire," he said, holding up a local news clipping about the spill. The cull came after looters - believed to have been spurred on by the arrest of former president Jacob Zuma - set fire to a warehouse owned by India's UPL Ltd. It took more than a week to control the blaze and stem the slew of chemicals that ran off from the firefighting into nearby uMhlanga estuary. UPL said it was "committed to making all efforts to eliminate (its chemicals) from the environment", confirming the warehouse held a number of pesticides and fungicides that could cause skin, eye and respiratory irritation. The arrest of Zuma in early July, for refusing to appear at an inquiry into high-level corruption, sparked protests that quickly evolved into widespread looting in the provinces of Kwazulu-Natal and Gauteng.
