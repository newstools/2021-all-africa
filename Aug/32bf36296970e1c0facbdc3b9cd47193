Legendary former national team and Dynamos midfielder, George Shaya, has died. Popularly known as the Mastermind, Shaya passed on barely two weeks after it was announced that a documentary of his legendary career, as one of the most celebrated yester-year footballers, would be premiered. The five-time Soccer Star of the Year had been battling illness for a while, a reason doctors recommended that his left leg be amputated in 2019. In his illustrious career, Shaya won the Soccer Star of the Year in 1969, 1972, 1975, 1976 and 1977, a record which is still to be replicated by any player in history.
