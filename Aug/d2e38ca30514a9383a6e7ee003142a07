Writing for The Conversation, Jonathan Cooper and Julien Reboud of the University of Glasgow have shared how their "origami" diagnostic system - which combines the accuracy of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test with the simple equipment of a lateral flow test - could be key to empowering people to administer tests and securely share their results with health authorities. This could be done by leveraging Africa's widespread adoption of smartphones; working with the Uganda Ministry of Health, a diagnostic app was developed to pair with the origami diagnostic system. Data from smartphones that have the app installed tell the healthcare professional what species of malaria the person is infected with. This ensures that the right drugs are correctly administered.
