AfroBasket, the biggest basketball event for national teams on the continent, begun on August 24, at the Kigali Arena and will run through September 5. The tournament has attracted 16 teams that include Nigeria, Senegal and Tunisia, to smaller ones like Cape Verde, Kenya and Rwanda. Unlike other countries that had to tussle it out for qualification for the 2021 edition, Rwanda automatically made it to the tournament as the host. All 36 games will be played at the Kigali Arena during the two weeks during which the tournament will happen. This year's tournament takes place under strict protocols employed to prevent risks of contracting or spreading the Covid-19 virus. Only fans with negative Covid-19 tests will be permitted in the arena. For Rwandans, it is mandatory to at least have taken one jab of the Covid-19 vaccine to access the arena.
