The High Court will reportedly start hearing three consolidated cases involving ownership of prime land in Nairobi that former President Moi reportedly sold to three different entities between 1988 and 2016. Moi, who died in February, 2020, is alleged to have sold the land located in Muthaiga to DPS International Limited in 1988 and thereafter to Muthaiga Luxury Homes Ltd in 2012. The former president is said to have sold the same property again in 2016 to Maestro Connections Health Systems Ltd. The court dispute started in 2016 with all purchasers claiming to be the legitimate owners of the property.
