President Emmerson Mnangagwa has warned Zanu-PF youths who are engaged in farm invasions and disrupting operations, to stop immediately or risk the full might of the law. Mnangagwa was speaking at Zimplats Mine in Mhondoro-Ngezi where he was launching a dairy project. Mnangagwa said the historic land reform programme that redressed colonial land imbalances at the turn of the millennium is in the past, and now the nation is focused on production in a peaceful country, assuring the restless youths the government would allocate 500 hectares of land in each province for them.
