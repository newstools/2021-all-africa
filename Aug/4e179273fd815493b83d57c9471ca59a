Kenya Power managing director Bernard Ngugi has reportedly resigned after serving the country's sole power distribution company for almost two years. He has been replaced with Rosemary Oduor, who was general manager commercial services and sales, in an acting capacity. Sources familiar with the events leading to his exit have reportedly said he handed in his resignation on August 3, 2021 after a tense and stormy board meeting.  The utility firm has in recent years been faced with a myriad of challenges including huge losses, debts, staff shortages, high operation costs and contracts with independent power producers that have left it operating at losses.
