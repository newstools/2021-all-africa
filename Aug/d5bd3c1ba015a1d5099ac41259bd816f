Pregnant women in Haroresa village, Tana River County, deliver not in hospitals with modern maternity services but in the bush. Lobbying of the county government for the past four years has yielded nothing, so expectant women find a spot in the wild and give birth to their babies on pieces of cloth with the help of midwives. The chosen area is first cleared of brush to leave the ground bare. The women then make a temporary circular makeshift shelter with sticks and leaves. An animal hide and pieces of wrapper (lesso) are spread on the ground. The result is a matter of sheer luck, as life is not guaranteed. Some deliveries are successful, others are not and in the worst circumstances, both mother and infant die, writes Stephen Oduor for The Nation.
