Sudan's Ambassador to Ethiopia, Jamal El Sheikh, has been summoned "to consult and identify options" after Ethiopia refused offers by Sudan to mediate in the ongoing and escalating conflict in the Tigray region". Last week, a statement by a spokesperson for Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed accused Sudan of "taking advantage of the Tigray conflict to enter Ethiopian territory". Sudan is currently chairing the regional body Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok said in a statement that he was trying to "encourage all Ethiopian sides to reach a ceasefire agreement, and engage in comprehensive political talks".           Fighting in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region began last November when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops in to defeat the region's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). Part of the issue stems from Fashaga, the contested border region that is used by Ethiopian farmers, but claimed by Sudan.           Sudan has been a place of refuge for tens of thousands of Ethiopians fleeing the fighting and the rape and abuse that has been documented. The UN says that this has created famine-like conditions for 400,000 people now in refugee camps in southeastern Sudan.
