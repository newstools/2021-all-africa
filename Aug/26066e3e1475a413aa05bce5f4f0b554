Unvaccinated patients are taking the hardest hit from Covid-19 infections and forming the bulk of admissions in hospitals, data from a city hospital has showed. Records collected by the Buru Buru-based Metropolitan Hospital in Nairobi since August 1 show that nearly 90% of their Covid-19 admissions are unvaccinated patients. The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released a study that showed that unvaccinated people are 29 times more likely to be hospitalised with severe Covid-19 disease, writes Hellen Shikanda for The Nation. The government has urged Kenyans not to be choosy when seeking to be vaccinated as there is no vaccine that is superior to the other when it comes to the prevention of severe diseases and death. As of August 20, 2021 Kenya has recorded 232,052 Covid-19 cases with 216,127 recoveries and 4,600 fatalities.
