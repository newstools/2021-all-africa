Around one-third of all rivers in Latin America, Africa and Asia are routinely exposed to untreated wastewater and agricultural run-off. Across the developing world, water quality monitoring is sporadic, especially in Africa. The United Nations Environment Programme has launched the Global Environment Monitoring System where experts provide guidance to graduate students and municipal officials around the world, on how to develop global capacity to monitor fresh water quality and to support assessments. Among the countries attending were Sierra Leone officials who with the support they received from UNEP, were able to develop a water monitoring system and begin testing sections of the Rokel River, which forms the country's most important water catchment area.
