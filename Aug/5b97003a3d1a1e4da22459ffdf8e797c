The parliament has been urged to expedite the passage of the Guardianship of Minors Amendment Bill that seeks among other issues, to prevent parents from consenting to the marriage of their underage children. This follows shortly after the arrest of a 26-year-old man, following the death of a teenager during childbirth - a case that sparked outrage among citizens and rights activists. Arrests and prosecutions of offenders are rare and authorities including politicians have often been accused of turning a blind eye to religious sects which have a lot of political influence. The UN has urged the Zimbabwe government to recognise child marriage as a crime and bring an end to the practice.
