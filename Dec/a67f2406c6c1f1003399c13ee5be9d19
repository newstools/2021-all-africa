The Zanzibar House of Representatives has passed a bill to establish the 'Zanzibar Drugs Control and Enforcement Authority into law. The law waiting to be asserted by the Isles President aims at "enhancing the authority's capacity" to deal with illicit and narcotic drug issues in the tourist Islands of Zanzibar.           The law will allow for an institution to be established that will be capable for investigating, arresting, investigating and prosecuting in court and also a significant reduction in drug-related trafficking, which will lead to a reduction in drug side effects; strengthening the workforce especially the youth, and ultimately boosting the country's economy; and controlling the use of prescription drugs that can be used as drugs.
