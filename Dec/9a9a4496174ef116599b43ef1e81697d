More than 25,000 smallholder farmers will benefit from a U.S$8.84 million grant by the International Fund for Agriculture Development to finance the Building Climate Resilience Project, as part of efforts to enhance the agriculture sector.           It looks to support 10,000 rice producers, 10,000 cocoa producers and 5,000 smallholder farmers from other enterprises, largely women and young people, to improve the livelihoods and climate resilience of rural farming households in Bong County.
