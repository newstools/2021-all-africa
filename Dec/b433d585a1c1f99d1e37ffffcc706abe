Kenya's Ministry of Health has announced it will enforce a rule requiring people to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to access public services, places, and events. The ministry is going ahead with the mandate despite a court order that postponed it pending a hearing next month. Health Chief Administration Secretary Mercy Mwangangi announced that one will have to show proof of vaccination to enter public spaces such as buses, grocery stores, restaurants and game reserves. Last week, the Kenyan high court suspended a state order that said the vaccine mandate would begin December 21. A hearing on the case is scheduled for January 14. As of December 19, 2021, a total of 8,902,539 vaccines had been administered across the country. Of these, 5,310,496 people were partially vaccinated while 3,592,043 were fully vaccinated. The government is working towards vaccinating a targeted population of 27,246,033.
