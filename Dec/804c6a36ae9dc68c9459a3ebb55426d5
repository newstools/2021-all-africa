When he took office 100 days ago, President Hakainde Hichilema pledged rapid transformation of the economy and the general way of doing business in government. After a decade and a half in opposition, the leader of the United Party for National Development defeated incumbent Edgar Lungu in elections on August 12, 2021, taking office 12 days later, writes Sishuwa Sishuwa for African Arguments. Although Hichilema's government continues to face several economic challenges, he has developed a clear strategy aimed at fixing the economy and its debt crisis through better fiscal management and accountability. Meanwhile, the appointment of the well-regarded Situmbeko Musokotwane as finance minister, the internationally respected Denny Kalyalya as governor of the Bank of Zambia and the experienced Felix Nkulukusa as secretary to the treasury, strengthens the country's ability to secure an IMF package. Such a bailout would help Zambia attract foreign direct investment, reassure ratings agencies, and re-negotiate debt payments and more.
