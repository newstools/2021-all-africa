"A lasting solution to the violence "requires a broader political commitment to address the root causes of conflict." the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in the DR Congo told the Security Council on December 6, 2021.           Bintou Keita, who also acts as the head of the UN Stabilization Mission in the country (MONUSCO) argued that, for stability to return, "the State must succeed in restoring and maintaining the confidence of the people in their ability to protect, administer, deliver justice and meet their basic needs."           In May 2021 authorities declared a state of siege in the provinces of Ituri and North Kivu, whose duration has just been extended for the 13th time. In fact, the period of the state of siege saw a 10% increase in the number of violations and abuses of human rights in the country, Keita said. On November 30, 2021 the Congolese Armed Forces initiated joint military operations with the Ugandan army against the rebel Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in the east. Looking ahead, Keita highlighted the importance of the elections scheduled for 2023, urging all political stakeholders to focus on key reforms needed to consolidate the hard-won stabilisation gains and overcome continuing challenges.
