A legal appeal brought by Ousainou Darboe against Gambian President Adama Barrow's election victory, has been rejected by the country's Supreme Court.           According to Chief Justice Hassan B. Jallow, Darboe's United Democratic Party "failed to comply with the requirement of Rule 11 of the Election Petition Rule, which required that you file a motion of petition and security."           Darboe did not concede and said the December 28, 2021 rejection of his appeal was a legal technicality more than a defeat.           The UDP had disputed the results of the December 4, 2021 poll in which Barrow won 53% of the vote. Darboe received around 28% of the vote and claimed there had been irregularities but did not produce any evidence to support the claim.
