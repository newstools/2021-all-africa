Africa's leading economic powerhouses, South Africa and Nigeria, are set to elevate bilateral and trade relations during President Cyril Ramaphosa's visit to Nigeria, which coincides with the 10th Session of the Bi-National Commission (BNC) between Nigeria and South Africa, also marking its 20th anniversary. Ramaphosa's and President Muhammed Buhari  need to make efforts to promote bilateral ties given their distressed economies, and also to lead the way in promoting the Africa Continental Free Trade Area. The two leaders are expected to sign a number of Memoranda of Understanding and agreements across political, diplomatic and economic, and trade relations, according to international relations expert, Olawale Olusola in The Conversation. Xenophobic attacks in South Africa have been a major drawback in contemporary African relations. Following xenophobic attacks in 2019, the South African government apologized to Nigeria. The South African leader will embark on a week-long, four-nation visit to West Africa from 30 November to 7 December 2021. Ramaphosa will tour Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Senegal, hoping to reinforce South Africa's bilateral relations with the countries concerned, and to strengthen partnerships directed at African development and cooperation in multilateral forums.
