There were protests in Khartoum on Sunday, to mark three years since the popular revolution which led to the end of autocrat Omar al-Bashir's rule.           In the run-up to the marches, security forces had sealed off major roads and bridges leading to the presidential palace where protesters had planned to march to.           Primer Minister Abdalla Hamdok who had initially been detained by the military but was then reinstated on November 21 has stressed that he wants to avoid further bloodshed and warned in a statement of "the country's slide toward the abyss".           A number of civic organizations and neighborhood committees organized protests calling for complete civilian rule. Many have expressed dissatisfaction with Hamdok's reinstatement because they argue it legitimises the October coup. There have been successive protests since the October coup and the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said that 45 people have been killed by security forces since the military takeover.
