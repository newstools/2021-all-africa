Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga has declared that he will run for the presidency for the fifth time in the 2022 polls. Odinga expressed hope that he will finally win the seat since his first attempt in 1997. This declaration ended four years of speculation that has characterised his politics since the March 9, 2018 handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta. He made the declaration at a fully packed, 60,000-seater Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani in Nairobi, witnessed by seven Cabinet secretaries, a host of chief administrative secretaries, principal secretaries and 21 governors. He annnounced that his manifesto will be pegged on a 10-point agenda he described as "People's Programme". He also launched the Azimio la Umoja Movement, an umbrella organisation that will be a coalition of all political parties that supports his presidency. Odinga will be up against Deputy President William Ruto among other candidates for the 2022 election.
