At least 38 people have died in a fire in an overcrowded central prison in Gitega. It's not clear yet what caused the blaze but local media reports that more than 1,500 prisoners were held in overcrowded cells designed to hold 400.           Vice President Prosper Bazombanza said that more than 60 other prisoners were injured, some seriously. One prisoner claimed guards were reluctant to open the cells.
