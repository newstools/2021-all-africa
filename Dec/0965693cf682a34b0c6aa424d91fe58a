Africa is importing too excessively and manufacturing too little, and the continent must change course by boosting intra-Africa trade and output. That was the message delivered during a three-day visit to Washington, DC by the head of the African Continental Free Trade Area Secretariat, Wamkele Meme. After a delay caused in part by pandemic complications, negotiations to finalize protocols are progressing towards completion, he told U.S. officials and think-tank audiences he met during his trip. The African Free Trade Area, creating a single market for 54 countries,  will be the largest in the world measured by the number of particpating nations.
