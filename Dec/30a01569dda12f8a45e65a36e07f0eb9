Tunisian Justice Minister Leila Jaffel wants the prosecutor-general at the Court of Appeal of Tunis to initiate an investigation into the circumstances around the death of the late former president Beji Caid Essebsi, the spokesperson for the court, Habib Torkhani has said.           The late leader was hospitalised during the night of July 24 and 25, 2019 in intensive care, according to the presidency. Essebsi was the country's first democratically elected leader, following the Arab Spring - a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions that spread across much of the Arab world in the early 2010s. It was influenced by the Tunisian revolution in response to corruption and economic stagnation under the rule of former president Ben Ali.
