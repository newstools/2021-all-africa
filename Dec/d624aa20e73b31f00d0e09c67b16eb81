Working with village leaders and local groups, fishers on the shores of Lake Malombe have been learning about conservation measures designed to regenerate the quality and quantity of fish in the lake and to safeguard their environment. Despite being landlocked, Malawi has many lakes and a rich fishing tradition, with nearly 1.6 million people in lakeside communities depending on fishing for their lives and livelihoods. Climate change is also threatening Lake Malombe's future productivity as temperature changes and fluctuating rainfall impact the fish, their habitat and biodiversity.
