Africa faces 10 key governance challenges it must resolve in order for it to fully recover from the Covid-19 outbreak, according to this report by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation. And unless the continent can vaccinate 70% of its population by the end of 2022, its chances of overcoming the pandemic will be severely reduced. Only 6.8% of the continent's population was fully vaccinated by November 18, 2021, while just five African nations are predicted to meet the 40% population vaccination target set by the World Health Organisation by the end of 2021. The ten challenges discussed in the Covid-19 in Africa: a challenging road to recovery report relate to the continent's capacity to secure sustainable recovery in the areas of health, society and the economy. The report also draws from a decade's worth of data from the 2020 Ibrahim Index of African Governance to determine each African country's performance relative to the ten challenges.
