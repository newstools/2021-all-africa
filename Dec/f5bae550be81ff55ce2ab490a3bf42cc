The UN has said that large amounts of food supplies have been looted from their warehouses in the northern state of Amhara in Ethiopia, leading to the suspension of food distributions in two towns.           "The World Food Program teams on the ground were not able to prevent the looting in the face of extreme intimidation, including staff being held at gunpoint," UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters.           Forces aligned with the Tigray People's Liberation Front, or TPLF, pushed federal army troops out of the Tigray region in July 2021 - expanding their movements to the neighbouring states of Amhara and Afar. Food insecurity has been escalating in these regions because of the 13-month-long conflict.           The United Nations has been a target of anger by both the federal government and now the Tigray forces. On September 30, 2021 the government declared several senior UN humanitarian officials persona non grata and expelled them, saying they were interfering in the country's internal affairs. The government has since arbitrarily detained several Ethiopian UN staff, and are currently holding nine staff members and three dependents in detention.
