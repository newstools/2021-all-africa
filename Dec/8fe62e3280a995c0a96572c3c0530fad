A bus taking a church choir and other revellers to a wedding in Kitui County on November 4, 2021 keeled over and sank beneath fast-flowing waters as the driver tried to navigate a submerged bridge at the Enziu River. Twelve passengers reportedly managed to scramble to safety but most aboard the stricken bus were unable to escape before it was swallowed by the muddy tide.  More than thirty bodies have been pulled from the river thus far. President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent his condolences to the families of the victims and urged citizens to be cautious on roads during the rainy season.
