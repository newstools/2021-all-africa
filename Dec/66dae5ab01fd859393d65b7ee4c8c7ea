Ugandan troops have joined the DR Congo in an airstrike against members of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) whom they blame for recent suicide bombings in the Ugandan capital city Kampala, that killed five people. Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni vowed at the time of the bombings, that the perpetrators would be arrested and punished. The ADF has been fighting the Ugandan government since 1996 and claims affiliation with the Islamic State militant group, writes Halima Athumani for Voice of America. "This has been a wish, actually for both presidents - Uganda's Museveni and DR Congo's Felix Tshisekedi - because the ADF is not only a threat to Uganda, but a threat within the region and a threat to DR Congo itself. I think this has been something that we've been looking for, for quite some time," Ugandan Brigadier-General Flavia Byekwaso  said. There are claims that over the years, the ADF has maintained sleeper cells in Uganda that it uses to strike at targets inside the country, with improvised explosive devices and guns - with the latter being used to target high profile individuals, writes Julius Barigaba for The East African.
