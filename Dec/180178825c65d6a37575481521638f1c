Despite facing two counts of crimes against humanity, murder and persecution at the International Criminal Court (ICC), allegedly committed in 2011 in Libya, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the fugitive son of the late ruler, Muammar Gaddafi, can stand as a presidential candidate in this month's elections. A court in the southern province of Sabha finally ruled in favour of Saif Gaddafi, having failed to convene for almost a week after the building was surrounded by armed men who stopped judges from entering. Earlier, Libya's High National Elections Commissions had determined that he was ineligible to run. In 2015, a domestic Libyan court found  him guilty and sentenced him to death in absentia for war crimes committed during the violent uprising against his father. His candidacy follows six years of being held by tribal militias and his defiance of an ICC arrest warrant.
