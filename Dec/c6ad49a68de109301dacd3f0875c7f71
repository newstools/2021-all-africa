The Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC) has in its report made public, recommended the banning of ten senior judges - referred to as "mercenary judges" from holding government office for their alleged roles in allowing ex-president Yahya Jammeh to interfere or use the justice sector institutions, to strengthen his grip on power and entrench his dictatorship.           The commission said the government should review the law on refusal to obey court orders by public officials, with a view to putting in place a more stringent regime that would ensure compliance. It added that the government should study the implications of the fusion of the two positions of Attorney General and Minister of Justice and consider the potential benefits of separating the two functions for more effective administration of justice.           The TRRC was established to investigate crimes committed in The Gambia under the leadership of Jammeh from 1994 to 2017. The report resulted in a three-year-long investigation during which the commissions heard testimonies from witnesses on different issues.
