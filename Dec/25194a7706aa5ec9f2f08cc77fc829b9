President Adama Barrow is seeking re-election, but with his own National People's Party (NPP) - and on a fractured ticket. The transitional president, who said he would step down after three years and not run again, made a surprise announcement when his new NPP party said he was joining forces with former dictator Yahya Jammeh's Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC) party. There are questions on whether Barrow should be allowed to run at all.           The youth vote is expected to play a pivotal role in the December 4 poll - where former dictator Yahya Jammeh still has support, despite living in exile in Equatorial Guinea and being accused of rights abuses. As voters get ready for the polls, many are hopeful that the power transition will be peaceful regardless of the outcome.  But former dictator Jammeh is not entirely out of the picture. Despite being in exile, he still retains significant political support among some Gambians, and his shadow could yet destabilise the country's democratic transition, writes Laura Angela Bagnetto for RFI.
