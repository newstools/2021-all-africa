Ghanaians in general, and the opposition in particular, have vehemently opposed the proposed 1.75% tax on electronic transactions, popularly known as e-levy, contained in the 2022 budget.           If passed, the law would include taxes on mobile money payments, which is used by 40% of Ghanaians 15 years and older, according to a 2021 data by the central bank.           Lawmakers exchanged blows late Monday evening over the proposed tax which the government says would boost revenue for development. Parliament has been split over the idea and fights broke out when supporters tried to force a vote.           About 50 lawmakers took part in the brawl only one was injured.
