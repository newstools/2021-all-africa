Medical experts have said that a drop in coronavirus cases indicates the country has passed the peak of a fourth wave of infections driven by the Omicron variant, Voice of America reports. Health officials say, while some areas of the country are still seeing increases, most provinces are levelling off. "All indications are that we've ... surpassed the peak of infections in Gauteng. This is encouraging and quite optimistic in terms of the decreasing trends in case numbers," said Dr. Michelle Groome of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. This comes after a government statement confirmed that while the Omicron variant is now the dominant strain of Covid-19 in South Africa, findings show that it is less severe, with fewer hospitalisations compared to the previous waves. As of December 23, 2021, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in South Africa reached 3,353,106 while over 18,768,087 vaccinations have been administered.
