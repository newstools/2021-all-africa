Angelo Charmant Igitego, 31, saw a need for developing filing software system tailored for Rwanda's healthcare needs, after his daughter died at Muhima Hospital. He says after his loss he still had to stay in a queue for five hours waiting for the cashier to bill more than fifty other patients, manually - cross checking a price list of hundreds of billable items with varying tariffs based on a patient's insurance provider and coverage rate. During his daughter's hospital stay, Igitego says one of the nurses was constantly sorting and filling out patient files manually and had no time to come and check on her. Since he had a background in Information Technology, Igitego decided to start Karisimbi Technology Solutions, a company that he says was borne out of frustration. His project scooped U.S.$12,500 during Hanga Pitch Fest, a startup competition organised by the Rwandan government. He said the prize will help him increase staff and equipment, to expand services. Igitego's company is now serving 20 private healthcare facilities across the country, and the system is currently managing more than 25,000 patient visits on a monthly basis. They have also created jobs for around 8 people and are looking forward to working with public health facilities.
