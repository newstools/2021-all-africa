In their Christmas messages, Christian leaders across Africa have called for dialogue, democracy, peace - and vaccinations against Covid-19. In Ethiopia, Catholic bishops declared that ever since they saw the signs of war in Tigray, "we have expressed in every way through declarations and prayers, the invitation to all actors to consider the path of dialogue rather than that of arms." In South Africa, the Anglican archbishop warned that if coalition politics do not improve people's lives, there is a danger that citizens will turn away from democracy to authoritarian rule, while in South Sudan a Catholic bishop expressed the hope that despite "the political shouting" and violence the pandemic has forced us to realize that we rely on one another as a human family. In Ghana religious leaders advised the public to take all necessary precautions and urged those who have not been vaccinated to get their shot.
