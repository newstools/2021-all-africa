The UN Human Rights Council has voted in favor of establishing a panel of experts to report on rights violations during the year-old war in Ethiopia, despite protestations from Addis Ababa, Deutsche Welle reports. Ethiopia lashed out at what it called a "neocolonialist mentality" following the EU-led effort to have a special session of the UN Human Rights Council called to address war crimes that may have occurred in Ethiopia. The resolution was brought forward to a vote by the EU. The resolution passed with 21 states in favor, 15 opposed, including Russia and China, and 11 abstentions. Nada al-Nashif, the UN deputy high commissioner for human rights, told the session, "Our office continues to receive credible reports of severe human rights violations and abuses by all parties." "The humanitarian impact of the conflict is increasingly dramatic," al-Nashif added.
