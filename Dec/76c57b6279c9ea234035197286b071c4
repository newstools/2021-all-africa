The Gambian truth and reconciliation commission has found former President Yahya Jammeh responsible for a spate of killings, rapes and torture during his 22-year long dictatorship and recommended that he be tried before an international tribunal.           "Over a period of 22 years, starting from July 22, 1994, Yahya Jammeh and... co-perpetrators committed very serious crimes against the people of The Gambia," a statement from the commission said.           The commission said that Jammeh and his henchmen, including a personal hit squad called The Junglas, were responsible for 44 specific crimes against journalists, ex-soldiers, political rivals and civilians. The commission recommended "prosecuting Yahya Jammeh and his co-perpetrators in an international tribunal" in West Africa outside of Gambia, under either the African Union or the ECOWAS regional group, the statement added.
