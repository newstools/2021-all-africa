Sudan's Prime Minister has terminated the services of acting state governors who were appointed by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Gen Abdelfattah El Burhan, following the military coup d'état on October 25. The prime minister also recently replaced several ministers who had been appointed by the military - some were closely linked to the former regime of Omar Al Bashir.           A top UN diplomat in Sudan earlier warned that the country's political crisis is not over, despite a November 21 power-sharing agreement between the military and the civilian prime minister that released him from detention and returned him to office.           Sudan's military seized power on October 25, arresting dozens of officials in the country's transitional government, including Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. The military said the coup was necessary to maintain Sudan's stability amid infighting between the army and civilian parties in the ruling Sovereign Council.
