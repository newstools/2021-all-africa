Newly elected Cameroon Football Federation boss Samuel Eto'o insists the 2021 Afcon scheduled in his country next month will go on. Eto'o, an African football legend, has played down calls from a host of clubs across the globe to let CAF cancel the tournament due to the resurgence of Covid-19 as well as European clubs being reluctant to let their players leave at a critical part of the season.  Eto'o has questioned why the European Cup was played in the middle of the pandemic with full stadiums but an African event cannot do the same. Rights group Human Rights Watch has also express concerns over lingering questions about the government's ability to guarantee the security and well-being of players and fans over prevailing insecurity in the two English-speaking regions of the country where matches will be played.
