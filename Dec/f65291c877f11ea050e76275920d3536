Cabo Delgado, the northernmost province of Mozambique, has been suffering violent attacks from militants since 2017 that have forced hundreds of thousands of people to become internally displaced. Over 2020, the conflict escalated. In March 2021, it peaked when a coordinated and brutal attack took place in Palma, transforming a once busy city, home to Total's billion-dollar gas liquefaction infrastructure, into a ghost town. In recent months, the armies of Mozambique and other allied countries in the region have launched offensives to regain control of areas where people have fled from. Some of the retaken areas have been prepared or are being prepared for those who have left to return. At the same time, the recent offensives have forced militants to disperse and the violence has lessened, however, there are still frequent outbreaks of conflict that continue to force people to flee.
