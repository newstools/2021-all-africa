Opponents of Tunisian President Kais Saied have slammed his decision to extend the suspension of parliament, accusing him of dealing another blow to democratic process.           In July, President Saied suspended parliament and froze the legislature in a move described by the opposition as coup and a violation of the constitution.           He said Monday that parliament would remain suspended until new elections on 17 December next year, the anniversary of the start of the revolution that chased dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from power.           Some politicians, lawyers, journalists and MPs critical of the president have since been arrested and jailed since Saied, who came to power in 2019, had in October moved to rule by decree, escalating fears for the only democracy to have emerged from the 2011 Arab uprisings.           Tunisia faces mounting public debt, inflation, 18 percent unemployment and stalled negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for its fourth bailout since the revolution.           But the 63-year-old president's focus has remained firmly on remaking the political system and tackling opponents -- primarily Ennahdha -- whom he he accuses of corruption.
