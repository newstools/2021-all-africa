With productivity-boosting measures, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement could reduce poverty and inequality while spurring sustainable and inclusive growth, according to a report launched on Wednesday by the UN trade and development body, UNCTAD. Intra-African trade - currently at a low 14.4 per cent of total African exports - would benefit greatly from regional trade, UNCTAD says. The Economic Development in Africa Report 2021, underscores the importance of infrastructure financing that helps link up urban and rural areas, and equal access to opportunities and resources. The free trade area, which began officially in January, is one of the flagship projects of the African Union's Agenda 2063.
