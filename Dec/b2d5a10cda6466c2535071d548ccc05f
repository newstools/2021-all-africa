Mangroves are a type of tropical forest that has evolved to thrive in hot, muddy, salty conditions and serves as a crucial breeding ground for fish, offers protection from storm surges and absorbs carbon from the atmosphere. Recognising the value of these unique forests, local women in Lamu have been working hard to replant mangroves in their community with the support of NGOs, government and funders.
