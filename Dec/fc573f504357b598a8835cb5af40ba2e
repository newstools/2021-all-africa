West African leaders have called on the international community to support the sanctions imposed on Guinea and Mali so as to promote peace, security, and stability in the region. The call was made in a communiqué issued at the end of the 60th Ordinary Session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS, held in Abuja.           The leaders demanded that the junta in Mali sticks to its plans for February polls, threatening further sanctions if Bamako fails to commit to returning to democracy. The head of Mali's government had earlier promised he would provide the bloc with an election timetable by the end of January 2022. The bloc suspended Mali following military coups in August 2020 and May 2021.
