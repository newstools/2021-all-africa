The use of chemical pesticides that are not environmentally friendly and destruction of bee habitats, are mainly behind the decrease in production of honey in parts of the country, researchers have found. The production of honey is continuously decreasing because of land use change and bee population decrease according to the research done by Elias Bizuru who is a conservation researcher and also a lecturer at University of Rwanda College of Science and Technology. Bizuru has called for integrating organic farming in agricultural practices saying the production of honey, in one case, shifted from five tonnes per year down to 0.5 tonnes per year corresponding to a loss of 90% of honey production.
