Life-saving sexual and reproductive health services are more vital than ever, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) has said during the launch of its largest ever humanitarian appeal to reach over 54 million women, girls and young people in 61 countries in 2022. The total appeal is for U.S.$835 million and the objective is to reach more than 54 million women, girls and young people in 61 countries, amid rising needs due to conflict, the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges. UNFPA has supported millions of people worldwide during the course of this year, reaching nearly 30 million women with sexual and reproductive health services in 2021. More than 4.3 million adolescents and young people also received services tailored specifically to them. The UN agency also assisted in over 1.5 million safe deliveries, supported family planning services for another six million people, and ensured more than 2.4 million survivors of gender-based violence received psychosocial support, legal assistance and livelihood training.
