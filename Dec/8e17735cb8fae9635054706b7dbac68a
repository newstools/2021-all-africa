Nigeria is investigating a serving state governor who has withdrawn more than U.S.$146 million in cash since 2015 as part of efforts to combat graft, according to the country's top anti-corruption official. The chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Abdulrasheed Bawa, said a governor from a state in Nigeria's North Central region carried out the cash transactions "within the last six years." The EFCC has said that Nigerians will be able to get the details of the cash manipulations with impunity once the North-Central governor's tenure elapses on May 29, 2023. The North Central zone covers six of Nigeria's 36 states: Benue, Kogi, Kwara, Nasarawa, Niger, and Plateau.  The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission was established in 2003 as a law enforcement agency that investigates financial crimes and other corruption cases.
