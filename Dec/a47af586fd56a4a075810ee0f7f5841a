The U.S. government has slapped economic sanctions on Senator Prince Yormie Johnson (PYJ) for alleged corruption. It also appears to be a step closer in nabbing the notorious warlord for war crimes he allegedly committed.           The U.S. Mission in Liberia said on International Anti-Corruption Day - observed annually on December 9 - that it stands in solidarity with all those committed to confronting and ending widespread corruption. This includes those within government who are opposed to corruption, as well as committed Liberian citizens and international organisations seeking to challenge the impunity of corrupt officials.
