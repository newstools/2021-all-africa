During a virtual briefing, the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has said it is probing U.S.$936 million worth of alleged irregular contracts relating to the procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE). The SIU, led by its chief, Andy Mothibi, briefed parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA), on its investigations into alleged corruption related to the procurement of PPE for the Covid-19 pandemic. Making introductory comments, SCOPA Chairperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa called corruption during a health crisis a "crime against humanity". During the briefing, the SIU said that between April 2020 and June 2021, novel coronavirus-related expenditure was about U.S.$8.7 billion. Of this amount, the SIU is investigating about U.S.$936 million, or about 11%, of which contracts worth R1.9-billion were referred to the Special Tribunal to have them set aside and the money recovered. The SIU said 5,054 contracts for novel coronavirus-related services were under investigation, with contracts awarded to 2,686 service providers.
