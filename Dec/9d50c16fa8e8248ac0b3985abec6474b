Malawi ranks as the 12th highest in the world for early and forced marriages, with 42% of girls getting married before reaching the age of 18, First Lady Monica Chakwera has said. Speaking during the opening of the National Girls Education Symposium in Lilongwe, Chakwera expressed disappointment with the rating, stressing the need for all stakeholders to collaborate in addressing the problem. The number of girls who marry before their 15th birthday has remained unchanged for 20 years in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with nearly four in 10 girls married before age 18. In multiple countries across Africa, customary and religious laws have been found to uphold practices that discriminate against women and undermine gender equality. Customary and religious laws have been linked to high rates of child marriage, decreased female autonomy, and limited access to justice for women and girls.
