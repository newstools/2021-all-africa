The man Nelson Mandela described as "public enemy number one" to the South African apartheid regime has died. And on the passing of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu John Allen, former managing editor of AllAfrica, who covered Tutu as a journalist for 45 years and acted as his press secretary for 13, the author of the definitive Tutu biography, Rabble-Rouser for Peace, and the compiler and editor of three volumes of key Tutu texts, writes about Tutu's life of passion, courage, faith and deep insight - "but it was a life lived against the odds". Tributes are pouring in for the Nobel Peace Laureate.           "While we mourn his passing, as Christians and people of faith we must also celebrate the life of a deeply spiritual person whose alpha and omega - his starting point and his ending point - was his relationship with our Creator. He took God, God's purpose and God's creation deadly seriously. Prayer, the Scriptures and his ministry to the people God entrusted to his care were at the heart of his life," the Most Revd Dr Thabo Makgoba, Archbishop of Cape Town and Metropolitan of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa said in a statement.
