Of its 13 million habitants, Rwanda has fully vaccinated 40% against Covid-19. This coverage milestone puts the country on track for meeting further vaccination global targets set by the World Health Organization. In May 2021, WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, set three targets of which Rwanda has reached the first of 10% inoculation by September and the second of 40% by the end of 2021. Following this trend, Rwanda is set to reach the third target of 70% inoculation by mid-2022. Between September and December, the vaccine supplies improved and over 8 million new doses were administered. Among WHO member states, only half have vaccinated 40% of their populations by December 2021.
