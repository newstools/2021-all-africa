Malawi authorities have arrested former finance minister Joseph Mwanamveka, former reserve bank governor Dalitso Kabambe and former local government minister Ben Phiri over the sale of a state-owned bank. Police say the three are facing charges of abuse of office and fraud.  The arrests come days after Malawi's Attorney-General Thabo Chakaka Nyirenda, told reporters that the government is investigating the sale of Malawi Savings Bank and also issues that led the IMF to withhold its extended credit facility to Malawi. In 2015, former president Peter Mutharika's administration sold the state-owned savings bank to Thom Mpinganjira, who is now saving a nine-year jail term for attempting to bribe judges who were handling a 2019 election dispute case. The government says the arrests are aimed at cleaning up corruption but the opposition Democratic Progressive Party says the arrests are a form of political persecution.
