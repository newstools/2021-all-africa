Poll ratings for Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga are climbing ahead of the announcement of his candidature for the presidency, a new opinion poll released by research firm Tifa shows. However, Deputy President William Ruto is the candidate to beat in the 2022 election, according to the poll. It showed that Ruto is the most popular presidential aspirant ahead of Odinga, Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka and Gideon Moi of Kanu, among others. Ruto, the poll shows, enjoys a national support of about 38%, while Odinga stands at 23%, with Mudavadi coming in at number three with 2%. Both Musyoka and Moi have 1% support. The deputy president however, suffered a decline in his national support after his figures fell by about one percentage point, from 39% in June 2021 - when Tifa conducted its earlier opinion poll - to 38% in November 2021, writes Silas Apollo for The Nation.
