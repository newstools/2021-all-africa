Nigeria's inflation rate fell for the eighth consecutive month in November to 15.40% from 15.99% recorded a month earlier amid a continuing increase in food prices, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The country has said the persistent inflationary pressures are structural - linked to deficits and not solely a money supply issue - and largely imported. Nigeria imports many key goods and services. A dollar shortage has prompted the government to put restrictions on forex for certain items, keeping the pressure on prices. The World Bank in November urged Nigeria to end its costly fuel subsidy within the next three-to-six months, improve exchange-rate management, and speed up other reforms to boost growth. Nigeria had been grappling with low growth since before the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a recession and created large financing gaps, including dollar shortages and inflation.
