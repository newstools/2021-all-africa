Well ahead of other African countries, Tanzania introduced a universal primary education programme in 1974 in keeping with its "education for self-reliance" policy. The government then estimated that 85% of the population was illiterate and extremely poor. Hunger, widespread disease and a low average life expectancy of just above 40 years, were also major obstacles. Periodic droughts, food shortages and limited access to international aid further complicated matters. What Tanzania still needs to do in order to achieve quality and inclusive education, is to prioritise disadvantaged and marginalised children in schools, and a human rights-based approach with commitment to recognising and respecting the rights of children while they are attending school, writes Simon Ngalomba, Lecturer, University of Dar es Salaam for the Conversation Africa.
