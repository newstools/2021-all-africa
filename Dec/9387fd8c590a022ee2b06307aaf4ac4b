Data from the Ministry of Education indicate that the group consists of 273 Technical and Vocational Training teachers as well as 33 who will be deployed in Teacher Training Colleges. Under the agreement, teachers will give lessons in associate nursing schools and the college of medicine and health sciences, the Rwandan ministry said. Zimbabwe's Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare minister Paul Mavima said the MoU had principles that promoted "decent work principles across the whole process of exchange of personnel and expertise, including critical issues in labour migration such as non-discrimination and portability of social security benefits.
