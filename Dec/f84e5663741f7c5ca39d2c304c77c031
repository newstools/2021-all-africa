President Nyusi has blamed the ongoing conflict in the country on the greed of militants in a recent address. According to Mozambique News Reports and Clippings, he rejected out of hand research and reports showing the importance of the grievances linked to growing poverty and inequality, despite this being well documented by a number of organisations. This while Carta de Moçambique reports that the military is building "profiles" of figures who disturb the ruling system, including investigative journalists, political opponents, social activists and academics. Recently military cadres have had training on monitoring and the use of a security system, called celebrity, which allows them to track and listen to calls, read messages on mobile phones and other electronic devices remotely. This comes amid reports of the conflict spreading to other regions of the country and Human Rights Watch saying that women and children have been abducted and sold by insurgents.
