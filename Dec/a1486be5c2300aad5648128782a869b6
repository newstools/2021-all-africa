The Sokoto government has said that 23 people died of injuries sustained from burns after shots were fired - allegedly by bandits - at a bus conveying travellers from Sokoto to Kaduna State. Violent attacks by armed bandits have increased in the past year, targeting villagers and commuters travelling on highways. There has also been an increase in the kidnapping of schoolchildren for ransom in the north of the country. While President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness at the gruesome bus attack, he assured that security agencies will bring the perpetrators to book.
