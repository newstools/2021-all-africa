A year after the withdrawal of the United Nations/African Union Hybrid Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), violence between armed groups, in some cases implicating state security forces, has been on the rise, with a devastating impact on civilians. Rights group Human Rights Watch is calling for the UN should deploy a robust human rights monitoring presence to the area, including expertise in gender-based crimes.           While various factors, often localized ones, played a role in the recent uptick in violence, the failure of the authorities over the last two years to provide meaningful civilian protection and justice for past and ongoing abuses have contributed to the escalation in violence and civilian harm.           On December 9, the Norwegian Refugee Council reported that there had been attacks on civilians causing death and mass displacement over five localities of West and also North Darfur over the previous three weeks.
