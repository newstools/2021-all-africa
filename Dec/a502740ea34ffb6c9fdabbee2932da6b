The implementation of Covid-19 protocols have adversely affected the businesses of women skilled in procducing shea butter, a fat extracted from the nut of the African shea tree. Shea butter is used in the production of chocolate, yoghurt, candies, and baby food, in addition to skin cream. Ninety percent of Ghana's shea butter exports go into the food industry, while the remaining 10 percent is used for skincare, involving women in local communities, according to Iddi Zakaria, national coordinator of Shea Network Ghana. "Shea oil is traded along three levels of the value chain... and then processed and sold to aggregators who then sell to large buyers, mostly in-country," says Zakaria. In October, 2021, the United Nations Development Programme pledged an additional U.S.$162,000 to some women shea butter producers in the Kumbungu District to acquire more machinery to make their operations easier.
