Resistance to antibiotics leads to a situation in which previously treatable infections are becoming harder - and sometimes impossible - to treat. Without urgent action, the world is heading for a post-antibiotic era. Common bacterial infections could once again become frequent killers. The World Health Organisation estimates that antibiotic-resistant bacteria kill between 700,000 and several million people every year. An alternative, is the use of probiotics rather than antibiotics in animal feed, writes microbiologist Deon Neveling for The Conversation.  Neveling developed a probiotic specifically for chickens, that contains multiple bacteria strains, which each target different areas of the gut to strive for complete gut protection. He explained that when humans consume meat or chicken, "we ingest not only the antibiotics added to animal feed, but also antibiotic resistant bacteria".
