Four farmers and a herder were killed in Mershing, South Darfur on December 1, 2021. In response, the area witnessed widespread protests, road closures, and calls for a further sit-in to protest the events.           Sources explained that the attack was the result of a violent incident in the vicinity of Abu Hamra, when herders released their cattle on several farms in the area. Darfur has a long history of strife between Arab herding tribes and non-Arab African herders or sedentary farmers, including the Masalit in West and South Darfur.           Also on December 1, 2021, tribal clashes broke out in Abu Jubeiha in the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan. The clashes led to dozens of deaths and injuries at a market and in the western parts of town, where a number of houses were razed. Witnesses explained that the violence erupted following the theft of cattle by Hawazma herders - a clan of the Arab Baggara tribe - from herders belonging to the Kenana tribe on November 30, 2021. The cattle owners immediately formed a search party that ran into a Hawazma ambush, where two Kenana tribesmen were killed. The following day, militant Hawazma and Kenana tribesmen attacked each other at the Abu Jubeiha market and the western parts of the town.
