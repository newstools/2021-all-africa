Somalia's President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed has announced the suspension of Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble, a day after the two men exchanged words over long-delayed elections in the Horn of Africa nation. An announcement from the presidential press office says that the decision to suspend the prime minister and relieve him of his powers had been taken because of his alleged links to corruption. Prime Minister Roble is accused in the same statement of interfering with an investigation into a land grabbing case.
