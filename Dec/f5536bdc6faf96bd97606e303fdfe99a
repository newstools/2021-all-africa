With the deadline to close Kenya's refugee camps just over six months away, there is an urgent need to find sustainable solutions for the refugees in the camps at Dadaab, who risk being deprived of the little assistance they currently receive, warns international medical organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).  In a new report released on December 6, 2021, MSF called on Kenya and its international partners to live up to the commitments made in the 2018 Global Compact on Refugees, by allowing Somali refugees to integrate into Kenyan society or to be resettled abroad. The report reveals that the number of refugees returning voluntarily from Kenya to Somalia has fallen sharply over the past three years - from over 7,500 in 2018 to less than 200 in 2020, according to UNHCR - coinciding with rising violence, displacement and drought within Somalia. Meanwhile, resettlement offers from rich countries have largely dried up, leaving refugees with little choice but to stay on in Kenya, where they have limited rights. Refugees in Dadaab are currently barred from working, travelling or studying outside the camps. The recent signing into law of Kenya's refugee bill could provide the chance for greater integration of refugees within Kenya, but this is dependent on it being implemented broadly to include all refugees, including Somalis, MSF says. The Dadaab complex is the largest refugee camp in the world and has a population of over 200 thousand registered refugees and asylum seekers. It consists of three camps - Dagahaley, Ifo and Hagadera
