On December 17, the Central African Republic's Special Criminal Court (SCC) announced it will send its first case to trial. The case involves alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in May 2019 in Koundjili and Lemouna by rebel leaders Issa Sallet Adoum, Ousman Yaouba, and Tahir Mahamat. Withnesses say on May 21, 2019, several dozen fighters from the armed group Return, Reclamation, Rehabilitation, or 3R, entered the village, summoned 11 men, and executed them. They killed two others while leaving. The same day, the group's fighters also killed 22 men in neighboring Lemouna village and at least 10 civilians in the town of Bohong. The brutal killings came just months after 3R leaders signed a peace accord designed to end such acts. In the days following the killings, the head of 3R, Sidiki Abass, handed over the three men now facing trial at the SCC to authorities and the United Nations.           Rights group Human Rights Watch has hailed this a significant moment in the Country. It how ever says there remains much to be done, including the re-arrest and trial of the SCC suspect Hassan Bouba after his surprise release last month. But if this trial serves as a step toward justice for serious crimes, it could help bring the country closer to durable peace.
