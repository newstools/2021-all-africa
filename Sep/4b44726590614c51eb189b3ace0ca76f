Over 1,500 groups are calling for a delay to the COP26 UN Climate Summit, as delegates from poorer nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America struggle to gain access to Covid-19 vaccines in time. There is also concern at the expensive quarantine costs ahead of the key talks, scheduled from October 31 - November 12, 2021 in Scotland.  The logistical challenges have thrown their attendance into doubt and host nation Britain, has so far failed to provide adequate support, said Climate Action Network (CAN) International, which has members in more than 130 countries. British officials have insisted the COP26 summit - billed as the last, best chance to galvanise the action needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius - will be inclusive, despite ongoing uncertainty over the Covid-19 pandemic. Britain has said that it wants to push forward, work on issues that are a high priority for poorer nations suffering climate change impacts, including finance for measures to adapt. Climate campaign groups however, have criticised the British government for moving too slowly on its offer to vaccinate delegates. The UK announced that it will pay for hotel quarantine, saying it is working "tirelessly" to vaccinate delegates and ensure inclusive climate talks - but activists say that aim is now impossible, writes Beh Lih Yi for The Conversation.
