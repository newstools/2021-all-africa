Barely recovering from the recent eviction which saw four housemates given the boot, now seven contestants are up for eviction. WhiteMoney,  Queen, Emmanuel, Saskay, Jackie B, JayPaul, Liquorose, and Saga are in the firing line. Pere was nominated for possible eviction but he used his veto to save and replace himself with Queen. The reality show is in its seventh week and the show is coming to an end on October 3, 2021.  The winner of this year's edition of the show will win the grand prize of U.S.$236,000 - the highest in the show's history.
