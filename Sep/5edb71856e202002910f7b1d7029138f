The Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, which was formed by Human Rights Council on September 30, 2016, to conduct a thorough investigation into human rights violations and abuses committed since April 2015, said that rights violations are continuing, albeit on a smaller scale than during the elections.           But National Independent Human Rights Commission (CNIDH) president Sixte-Vigny Nimuraba has said that the human rights situation has improved significantly despite an  outcry by the opposition over their members being harassed and arrested arbitrarily by security forces.           Burundi's main opposition leader Agathon Rwasa says that the arrest of party members were made, despite them respecting the rule of law.
