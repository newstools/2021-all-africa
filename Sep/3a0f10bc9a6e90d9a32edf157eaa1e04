Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan has confirmed her political ambitions, saying she intends to run for office in 2025 - to become the country's first elected female president if she were to win. Speaking at an event to mark the International Day of Democracy in Dar es Salaam, Suluhu Hassan said her own elevation to the top job was thanks to "the grace of God" and constitutional requirements. "This president (her) is leading because of God's wish and constitutional requirements," she said. She urged Tanzanian women to join forces to ensure a woman candidate wins the vote outright in the next presidential election. Suluhu Hassan made history when she was sworn in on March 19 as the first woman president of Tanzania following the death of her predecessor, President John Magufuli on March 17, 2021, when she was vice president.
