With five different types of Covid-19 vaccines available in the country, two of them will be dispatched to selected counties due to demanding storage requirements. Pfizer and Moderna have to be kept at -70° Celsius or below, and -20° Celsius, respectively. Their distribution will, thus, be based on the availability of cold-chain storage facilities. These are only available in Kitengela, Nairobi, Eldoret, Kisumu, Mombasa, Nakuru, Nyeri, Meru and Kakamega. The two vaccines will only be distributed to areas that are within a maximum of seven hours from regional depots. Garissa County will also receive them when the shipment of a specialised deep freezer suitable for the climatic condition arrives, writes Nasibo Kabale for The Nation. As of September 20, 2021 Kenya has recorded 246,530 Covid-19 cases with 237,295 recoveries and 4,989 fatalities.
