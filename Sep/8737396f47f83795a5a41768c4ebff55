An ad-hoc committee established to initiate and introduce legislation to amend Section 25 of the Constitution, has adopted the 18th Constitutional Amendment Bill. This will see the expropriation of land without compensation embedded in the Constitution. The Bill's approval comes after multiple hearings across the country with Committee chairperson Mathole Motshekga saying that it spanned the work of two parliaments and three committees. "It is a historic day as we adopt this Constitution 18th Amendment Bill," Motshekga  said. The expropriation of land without compensation has been a divisive topic for the nation's political parties with Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia de Lille describing the process as not being a "silver bullet" for land reform.
