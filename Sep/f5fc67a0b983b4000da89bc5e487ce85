Restrictions on movements of people and gatherings have been eased in South Africa following a steady decline in new Covid-19 infections, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced during an address to the nation on September 12, 2021. Ramaphosa said the decrease in the number of new infections across the country spurred the decision to move the country to a lower level of restrictions. "While the third wave is not yet over, we have seen a sustained decline in infections across the country over the last few weeks. The average number of daily new infections over the last week is 29% lower than the preceding seven days, and 48% lower than the seven days before that. While the third wave peaked in Gauteng province far earlier and declined far faster than in other provinces, there is now a marked decline across all provinces," he said. As of September 13, 2021, a total of 2,858,195 Covid-19 cases have been confirmed in the country, of which 84,877 proved fatal and 2,667,296 resulted in recovery. Vaccinations administerd to date amount to 10,720,370.
