The Tigray conflict has raged since November 2020, when long-standing tensions between the federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front came to a head, with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launching a military operation in Tigray that he described at the time as a "law and order operation". He accused the TPLF of targeting government military units and holding illegal elections in Tigray. The conflict triggered threats of international sanctions after the Ethiopian government suspended some aid organisations and reports of human rights violations emerged. In an update to the UN Human Rights Council (OHCHR) on the situation in the northernmost regional state in Ethiopia, UN Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet, told the council the conflict has "continued unabated and risks spilling over to the whole Horn of Africa".           Bachelet condemned the alleged gross violations of human rights, humanitarian and refugee law committed by all parties in the conflict. Bachelet also informed the Council on progress made in the joint investigation by the OHCHR and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) following the conclusion of the field work phase of the report. The full range of information collected is currently being analysed, but Bachelet said it was already clear that documented cases comprise multiple allegations of human rights violations.
