Cornelia Vermeulen, a registered nurse and who runs Cornelia's Care for Children, an organisation that helps parents navigate their mental health journey with their children, has said that schools and clinics are not well-equipped to deal with children living with autism, ADHD or any mental health problem. "Some of the teachers are not well educated to deal with these children. There is a big need to help these children at school. Because there is no help, [many] of them end up dropping out of school," Vermeulen said. The seniment was echoed by South African Democratic Teachers Union spokesperson Nomusa Cembi who said there is no special mental health training at schools.  "Teachers have been asking for psycho-social services at schools and we have been talking to the department of education to liaise with the department of social development but there is little to no services at all." According to the World Health Organization, approximately 10 to 20% of young children, including adolescents (globally) experience some type of mental health condition. Professor Petrus de Vries of the University of Cape Town says children and adolescents present with a huge range of mental health disorders. "There have not been any systematic studies in South Africa, but the rate is about 20% (one in every five children probably have a diagnosable and treatable mental health disorder). Mental health disorders are the number one health condition in those under 18 and 50 to 75% of adult mental health disorders have their onset in childhood or adolescence," he says.
