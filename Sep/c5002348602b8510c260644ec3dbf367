In the summer of 2019, Timilehin Ajiboye became intrigued with the idea of building a travel app after conversations with a circle of friends, writes Tage Kene-Okafor for TechCrunch. One friend reached out to Ajiboye asking if he knew of any platform where she could find new, aesthetically pleasing places to dine in, visit and take pictures. And then, during a trip to Miami, he and his friends actively sought out beautiful places to eat - and take photos. More than 36% of social media users use platforms for travel ideas, according to Statista; over 60% of these people share photos when travelling. There's currently no go-to platform to find attractive places just for the sake of it. The founders say Backdrop is primarily built for this, as well as travel discovery. With Backdrop, users can discover and share beautiful places to take pictures based on their interests and criteria. The founders believe that with post-pandemic travel becoming more complex, Backdrop can serve as a travel companion for millennials and Gen Zers, especially those obsessed with travelling to pretty places.
