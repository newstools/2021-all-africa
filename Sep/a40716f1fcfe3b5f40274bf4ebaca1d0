The Men's African Volleyball Championship kicked off at the Kigali Arena in Rwanda. Kigali is the first city in the East African region to ever host the continental tournament and the second to host the same tournament for women since Kenya in 2015. This is the fifth time that the championship has been held in the sub-Saharan countries after Code d'Ivoire (1989), Nigeria (2001 and 1997), and South Africa in 2007. Sixteen national teams are participating in the continental tournament. Guinea was one of the participating nations but withdrew, following the military takeover in the country.  Tunisia are holders of the 10th Men's African Volleyball Championship which they won on their home soil in 2017 after beating Cameroon 3-2 in Tunis. The defending champions are the most decorated team in Africa with 10 titles, having won it in 2003, 1999, 1997, 1995, 1987, 1979, 1971, 1967, and 2017. They are now in Kigali looking to retain the 2021 title to add to their trophy cabinet.
