The ruling African National Congress (ANC) faces a crucial week in which it might get a second chance to register its candidates for the local government elections, writes Carien du Plessis for Daily Maverick. This comes after South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission of South Africa's (IEC) held an urgent meeting following a Constitutional Court ruling, which gave it three days to decide whether it can hold a voter registration weekend. Failing that, the court ruled that voters have until September 10, 2021 to register at their local municipal offices before the voters' roll would close again and the elections be proclaimed afresh.   Uncertainty remained on whether the Constitutional Court ruling left room for the registration of party candidates to be reopened, as glitches and infighting meant that the ANC didn't register all its candidates in 94 municipalities, and risked losing power in a vast number of these, including in the Gauteng metros and in a number of KwaZulu-Natal councils. However, the Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs welcomed the IECs decision to reopen the voter and candidate registration for the 2021 local government elections. The Constitutional Court dismissed the IEC's application to postpone the elections until a later date, due to safety concerns as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
