South Africa's health department has confirmed that the United Kingdom would consider the data provided by the South African scientists in their next review of its red list - within 14 days. This comes after the scientists had a meeting with their UK counterparts over the red list of high-risk countries. The UK has tighter travel restrictions in place to reduce the introduction and transmission of new variants of Covid-19 from countries that the UK government says should not be visited "except in the most extreme of circumstances". This means that travellers returning to the UK from South Africa must spend 10 days in quarantine at their own expense, even though they are vaccinated. According to the health department, the talks also included the latest trends around Covid-19, testing strategies and the prevalence and risk posed to South Africa's vaccination programmes, by variants of concern. As of September 28, 2021, a total of 2,897,521 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in the country of which 2,762,812 resulted in recovery while 87,216 proved fatal. Vaccinations to date total 12,167,828.
