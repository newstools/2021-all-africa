The Kenyan government's response to gender-based violence during the Covid-19 pandemic has been too little, too late, Human Rights Watch has said in a 61-page report released on September 21, 2021. According to the report, survivors faced increasing harm due to Kenyan authorities' failure to provide among others, access to comprehensive medical treatment, mental health care and the ensuring the proper investigation and the prosecution of cases. The lack of services has seen an increase in sexual and other violence against women and girls. The report also found that due to corruption and the lack of transparency, those most in need did not receive vital Covid-19 cash relief promised by the government. Survivors also said that access to Kenya's already severely limited supply of shelters, or safe houses, was made more difficult by the violent enforcement of curfews and lockdowns.
