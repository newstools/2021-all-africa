Former South African president Jacob Zuma is being released from prison on medical parole, two months into a 15-month sentence. The government's Department of Correctional Services did not reveal the nature of Zuma's medical condition, but said that parole can be granted to "inmates suffering from an illness that severely limits their daily activity or self-care." He was imprisoned on July 7 for refusing to obey a court order to appear before a commission of inquiry into the government and private sector corruption which flourished during his presidency. His jailing triggered widespread violence in two of the country's provinces.
