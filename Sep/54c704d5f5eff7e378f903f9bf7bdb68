The U.S. Senate on Tuesday night confirmed Mary Catherin Phee for the top Africa policy post in the State Department by a vote of 67 to 31. Phee, who was nominated in April and approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in August, is a former Ambassador to South Sudan who has spent most of her career focused on Iraq and Afghanistan. Senate action was delayed by Texas Republican Ted Cruz overa dispute with the Biden administration over a nearly completed natural gas pipeline from Russia to the European Union. Numerous ambassadorial appointments have been blocked as well. In another key Africa-related nomination, the White House on Monday announced the selection of  John N. Nkengasong, who is currently Director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Addis Ababa, to oversee the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
