Alex Saab, a Colombian-born businessman, was mentioned extensively in the Panama Papers - documents containing personal financial information about wealthy individuals and public officials that had previously been kept private - for his dealings with the Venezuelan government. Saab has been investigated by Colombian authorities for alleged money laundering and faces the same charges in the U.S.  An Interpol Red Notice for Saab, led to his arrest in Cape Verde when his plane stopped to refuel en route to Venezuela, from Iran on June 12, 2020. While the ECOWAS Court ruled that his arrest was unlawful, the Cape Verde High Court's written judgement on August 30, 2021 and its publication on their website on September 7, 2021 states that Saab must stand trial in the U.S. Saab's lawyers now say they are "exploring their options" after the ruling was made. Saab is wanted on charges of money laundering through U.S. banks in connection with a Venezuelan bribery scheme.  Venezuela's socialist government has protested his arrest, saying Saab was acting as a "special envoy" seeking food, medical supplies and fuel for the South American country, writes Eugénio Teixeira for Voice of America.
