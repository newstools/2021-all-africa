Prime Minister Najla Bouden Romdhane, 63, a professor at a prestigious engineering school, is the first woman to hold that office in Tunisia. Romdhane has been asked to form a new government by President Kais Saied, after he dissolved parliament two months ago. Meanwhile, on September 26, 2021, thousands of protesters gathered in Tunis to denounce the exceptional measures decreed on July 25, 2021 and September 22, 2021 by Saied as a "coup", after he sacked Hicham Mechichi as prime minister and announced the freezing of Tunisia's parliament for 30 days, along with suspending the immunity of all deputies.
