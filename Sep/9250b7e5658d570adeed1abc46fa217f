Governors of 19 northern states have rejected the position of their southern counterparts, that the 2023 presidency should be zoned to the southern part of the country, arguing that the presidency is a democratic office and not a rotational position.  The southern governors had demanded that power must shift to their region at a meeting in July 2021. The Northern Governors' Forum said the region could not be compelled to give up a democratically elected office that could be sought by any person irrespective of where the candidate originates. The governors also opposed the position of their southern counterparts on Value Added Tax, (VAT). The northern governors have said that if every state of the federation follows the Lagos and Rivers example in VAT payments, there would be multiple taxation, a rise in prices of goods and services, and the collapse of inter-state trade. The meeting also noted with concern the constraint of the security services and urged the armed forces to embark on simultaneous operations. The host governor, Nasir el-Rufai, said the northern region is facing severe economic and security challenges that require the convening of the emergency meeting between the governors and traditional rulers.
