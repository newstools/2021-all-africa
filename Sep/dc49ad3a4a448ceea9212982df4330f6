To mix things up a bit as the final week fast approaches, Big Brother introduced the Ultimate Veto Power. With this power, the holder gets immunity and automatically secures a place in the final week as well as the opportunity to choose the Head of House and the Deputy Head of House.  It was luck and strategy that saw Emmanuel emerge as the ultimate veto power holder. He unsurprisingly chose his love interest, Liquorose, as the Head of House and Cross was lucky to be picked as deputy. However, the rest of the housemates - WhiteMoney, Pere, Nini, Saga, Angel, and Queen  - are up for possible eviction and only their fans' vote can help them to the finale. The reality show is in its seventh week and the show is coming to an end on October 3, 2021.  The winner of this year's edition of the show will win the grand prize of U.S.$236,000 - the highest in the show's history.
