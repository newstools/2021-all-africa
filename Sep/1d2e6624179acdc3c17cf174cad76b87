Millionaire businessman Revocant Karemangingo was gunned down in broad daylight in his car by gunmen using automatic weapons as he returned home from one of his businesses in the capital's outlying Matola suburb. The murder of a prominent critic of Rwandan President Paul Kagame in Maputo has confirmed fears of other Rwandan dissidents that the presence of Rwanda's troops in Mozambique is helping it to get at its own political enemies. Deutsche Welle has put together a list of mysterious deaths and disappearances of people critical of Rwanda's government. Monday's killing of businessman Revocant Karemangingo in Mozambique is the latest on the list. The regime of President Kagame, who has effectively ruled Rwanda since 1994, is accused of suppressing dissenting views. International rights groups claim opposition politicians, journalists, and activists at home in Rwanda and abroad have also been killed or made to disappear after criticizing Kagame or his ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front party.
