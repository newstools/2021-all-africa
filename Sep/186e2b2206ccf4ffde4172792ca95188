Paul Rusesabagina, a long-time critic of President Paul Kagame and the man who inspired the movie Hotel Rwanda, has been found guilty on terrorism charges. His story, in which he saved scores of people during the Rwandan genocide, was told in the Oscar-nominated film. His trial attracted international attention due to his role in rescuing hundreds of people during the 1994 Rwandan genocide against the Tutsis. Rusesabagina's fall from celebrated hero to state enemy reportedly developed as he criticised President Paul Kagame's government, even though some survivors of the genocide questioned the version shown in the 2005 movie. The terrorism charges relate to a series of attacks carried out by the armed National Liberation Front in southwestern Rwanda between June and December 2018, during which nine civilians were killed.
