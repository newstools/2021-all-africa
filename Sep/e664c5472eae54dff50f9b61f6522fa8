The Standing Committee on Public Accounts briefed by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) on progress in the ongoing investigations into the procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) for Covid-19 and the Digital Vibes contract. According to Mark Heywood for Daily Maverick, the suspension of Department of Health Director-General, Sandile Buthelezi, and long-time Deputy Director-General, Anban Pillay, appears imminent as they face disciplinary inquiries sparked by the SIU's inquiry into the Digital Vibes scandal. It is believed that other senior officials may also be suspended. PPE contracts between the Department of Health and service provider Digital Vibes prompted an investigation over the firm's connection to former health minister Zweli Mkhize and his family. Mkhize was placed on special leave by President Cyril Ramaphosa as a result.
