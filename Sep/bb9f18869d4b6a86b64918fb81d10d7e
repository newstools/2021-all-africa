Rwandan President Paul Kagame has called on all stakeholders in the justice sector to pool their efforts and find a lasting solution to the rising crimes related to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in the country. Kagame called for tougher punishment to send a warning to those who rape women and children and impregnate teenage girls. These remarks were made during the ceremony to launch the 2021/2021 judicial year that was held at parliament where he addressed a cross section of senior officials from civilian and military courts as well as high-ranking government officials and diplomats. "The authors of these crimes, their accomplices and those that protect them should face tough punishment," he said.
