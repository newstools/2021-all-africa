The crisis between the military and civilian components of the Sudanese transitional government has worsened, as security forces charged with the protection of recovered assets and the office building of the Empowerment Elimination Committee formed after the fall of Al-Bashir were instructed to abandon their posts, leaving the office and assets vulnerable.           In response, hundreds of activists flocked to the committee's office and declared their readiness to fill the security vacuum. Head of the UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) Volker Perthes held a series of meetings on September 28, 2021 with the civilian and military members of the Sovereign Council.           In a press statement after the meetings, Perthes affirmed the preparedness of the UN to hold a comprehensive dialogue between the partners of the transitional period. He emphasised the necessity to address issues of political transition through constructive dialogue between partners.
