A Rwandan civil society body based in France has implored the French government not to welcome the remains of the top genocide architect Col Théoneste Bagosora who died in a hospital in Mali on September 25, 2021 where he had been imprisoned since 2012. Bagosora was serving a 35-year sentence handed to him by the then International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Among his other crimes, Bagosora bears the most responsibility for the systematic killing of prominent personalities and opposition political figures who were a threat to the genocidal plan on the morning of April 7, 1994. Genocide survivors and family members of slain politicians were reportedly disappointed that the genocide mastermind showed no remorse for his crimes. The genocide claimed the lives of some 800,000 Rwandans - mainly from the Tutsi ethnic group but also those who were moderate Hutus.
