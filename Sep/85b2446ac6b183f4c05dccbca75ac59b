Zambia's new President Hakainde Hichilema who recently defeat the incumbent Edgar Lungu with 59% of the votes faces a few challenges ahead in fulfilling his promises. These include keeping his word on restoring the rule of law, assembling a strong team of ministers to steer the functions of state and getting the country out of debt by boosting investor confidence by attracting foreign direct investment.           The nation is full of expectation and hope in its new 'Mr Fixer', but this will not last long if people do not start to see improvements to their lives and livelihoods, writes Neo Simutanyi, a political scientist and Executive Director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) based in Lusaka.
