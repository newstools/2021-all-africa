The holding of presidential and parliamentary elections on 24 December 2021 needs to remain the paramount objective of the Government of National Unity (GNU). Any efforts to divert attention to other objectives work against the holding of the elections on the said date, The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said after reports that the House of Representatives (HoR) has passed a no-confidence motion against GNU. "Not holding the elections could gravely deteriorate the situation in the country, could lead to division and conflict," Ján Kubiš, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of UNSMIL warned.
