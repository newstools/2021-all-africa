Epilepsy is a serious condition and it can be difficult to find the right drug to treat it. Some commonly used antiepileptic drugs may show adverse effects. Most are expensive, and some may be ineffective.  A plant that grows in Nigeria shows promise as the source of a new drug. Tetrapleura tetraptera also known as aidan and uyayak, is a tree found in the West African rainforest belt. Its fruit gives a characteristic aromatic odour, making it a sought-after spice in some Nigerian dishes. Research into the plant found that an extract of its fruit could protect against seizure and prevent brain degeneration. It could therefore be studied further for the development of a new antiepileptic drug, writes Moses B. Ekong for The Conversation. Epilepsy is a brain disorder that arises from imbalances of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. This disorder manifests as recurring seizures, unconsciousness, and momentary loss of memory. These events are frequent and unpredictable. The burden of epilepsy in Nigeria is high, with estimated prevalence of eight per 1,000 people.
