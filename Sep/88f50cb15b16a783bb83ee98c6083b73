Algeria has closed its airspace to all Moroccan planes due to "provocations and hostile practices" by its neighbour, in the latest dispute between the countries at odds mainly over Western Sahara.           Relations between the countries have been tense for decades due to Algeria's support for the Polisario Front, which demands a self-determination referendum in Western Sahara. The Polisario Front has for decades, fought Morocco for the independence of Western Sahara. Morocco sees the former Spanish colony as an integral part of its territory. Algeria's decision was announced after a meeting of the High Security Council chaired by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune.            Algeria closed off air links due to the Covid-19 pandemic, reopening to seven countries in June, 2021 excluding Morocco.
