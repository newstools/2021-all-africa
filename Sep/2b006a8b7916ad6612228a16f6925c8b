Presidential elections were held in  São Tomé and Principe, a Portugese-speaking archipelago on July 18, 2021. Since no presidential candidate received a majority of the vote, a second round was originally scheduled for August 8, 2021 but was postponed twice, after a candidate complained about the first round results. On September 5, 2021 Carlos Vila Nova won the second round of presidential elections with 57.54% of the votes, according to provisional results announced by the National Electoral Commission. He beat incumbent Guilherme Posser da Costa from the ruling Sao Tome and Principe Liberation Movement (MLSTP/PSD) who came in second with 42.46% of the vote.
