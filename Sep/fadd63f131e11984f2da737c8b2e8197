Veld fires are posing serious challenges to the environment and sustainability in Zimbabwe, destroying crops, soil fertility, vegetation and animal species. The Environmental Management Agency has recorded an 84,97% increase in veld fire cases during the current fire season as compared to the same period in 2020. With at least 23 veld fire incidents having been recorded since July 31, 2021, thatch grass traders are playing a major role in prevention of outbreaks by cutting down grass, especially along highways. Thatch grass harvesting and sales have become lucrative, with Muzarabani, one of seven districts in the Mashonaland Central province, being the major market where traders exchange the grass with farming inputs, livestock and groceries.
