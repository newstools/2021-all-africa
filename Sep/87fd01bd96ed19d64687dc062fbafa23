The Department of Basic Education has announced that recruitment for Phase II of the Basic Education Employment Initiative will open on September 27, 2021 and close on October 03, 2021. The department seeks to provide 287,000 unemployed young people employment and training opportunities in the education sector, as part of the Presidential Youth Employment Initiative - Basic Education Employment Initiative, which forms part of the Presidential Employment Stimulus, seeking to counteract the economic challenges brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey of the 1st quarter of 2021, young people are still struggling in the South African labour market. The official unemployment rate is at 32,6%. Among young people aged 15-34 years, the rate is 46,3%, implying that almost one in every two young people in the labour force did not have a job in the first quarter of 2021. About a quarter (24,4%) of the youth have jobs and 45,3% of them participate in the labour market. Within the youth, those aged 15-24 years are more vulnerable in the labour market with an unemployment rate of over 63%, an absorption rate of about 7,6% and a labour force participation rate of 20,6%. The Covid-19 outbreak - which saw the nation's economy contract by 7% in 2020 in what was considered "the biggest drop in a century"  - has also necessitated the introduduction of a Basic Income Grant for unemployed non-grant recipients between the ages of 18 and 59.
