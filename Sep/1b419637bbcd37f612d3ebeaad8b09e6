Tanzania's health minister Dorothy Gwajima has launched mobile health facilities that are aimed at multiplying efforts in the fight against TB. Gwajima received five mobile clinics which will be handed out to Kilimanjaro, Mwanza, Mbeya, Dodoma and Dar es Salaam. 160 motorcycles, and 179 Electrocardiogram (ECG) machines are also to be distributed in five zones, to reach out to people particularly in rural areas, where there is no accessibility to such services, or which incurs high costs in reaching health centres. The minister said the country still has a long way to go in the fight against TB because out of 85,597 cases, only 63% of those infected have been treated while 49,403 people have not been diagnosed. The project is funded by Global Fund in Tanzania and has cost just over U.S.$2 million.
