Big Brother was back on air on July 24, 2021, with two opening shows, introducing 11 men and women as housemates to play and win the grand prize. Then in a twist, Big Brother added another four new housemates - Michael, Kayvee, JMK, and Queen.  But now, only four remain. Emmanuel, Cross, Liquorose and Whitemoney are pulling out all the stops to walk away with the grand prize.  However, Biggie has introduced yet another twist where Pere and Angel were taken to a secret room unknown to the other housemates. The duo are in a secret "white room" where they were given a task which will decide who will return to the house - with the other person evicted. The reality show is in its seventh week and the show is coming to an end on October 3, 2021. The winner of this year's edition of the show will win the grand prize of U.S.$236,000 - the highest in the show's history. Who do you think will be the winner who takes it all?
