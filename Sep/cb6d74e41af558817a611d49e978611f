Mali Prime Minister Choguel Maiga has defended comments he made before the UN General Assembly that France had abandoned his country in mid-flight with the "unilateral" decision to reduce the number of French troops in the country.           Maiga ripped into France during his address to the General Assembly, accusing Paris of abandoning it by preparing to withdraw its Barkhane force - halving its troops in the Sahel by 2023.           He also said Mali could push back presidential and legislative elections from the February 2022 date proposed by ECOWAS. Maiga is handling the transition back to democracy, following the August 2020 overthrow of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.
