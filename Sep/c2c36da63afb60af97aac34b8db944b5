Sudanese authorities have reportedly contained a coup attempt and the situation has been brought under control, a member of the country's ruling council has said.           A  source said the coup attempt involved an effort to take control of state radio in Omdurman, across the river Nile from the capital, Khartoum. Interrogation of the  suspects is due to begin and the military will issue a statement shortly, spokesman Mohamed Al Faki Suleiman has said.           Sudan is being ruled under a fragile power-sharing deal between the military and civilians following the ouster of former president Omar al-Bashir in April 2019. Transitional authorities have said they foiled previous coup attempts linked to factions loyal to Bashir.
