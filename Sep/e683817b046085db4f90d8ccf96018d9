With the African Growth and Opportunity Act expiring in 2025, what are the prospects for a revised African trade initiative? According to long-time Congressional staffer Tom Sheehy, "the policy path is less clear than when Agoa became law, and the prospects for a substantial African trade initiative gaining political support are more challenging." A bipartisan coalition in Congress that has back Agoa passage in 2000 seems unlikley now. "Competition with China could help drive an Africa trade agenda, but supporters must first figure out the policy," says Sheehy, who was a key participant in the African trade policy deliberations as staff director of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for six years.
