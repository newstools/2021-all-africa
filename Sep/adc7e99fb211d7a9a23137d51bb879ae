The Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC) has announced that it has reached an agreement with the National People's Party (NPP) to re-elect President Adama Barrow for a second term.           APRC, the former ruling party of former leader Yahya Jammeh, lost the 2016 election to the- independent candidate Barrow, who is now the leader of the NPP. After the announcement of the result by the Independent Election Commission, the former president conceded defeat but later made a dramatic turnabout, claiming that the election was not fair and called for a re-election. Jammeh's refusal to step down resulted in political impasse in which about 40,000 Gambians fled to Senegal.           After months of negotiation, APRC and NPP signed an agreement on what they described as, the interest of the country and in the interest of national reconciliation.           Part of the agreement APRC officials said, is to ensure that Yahya Jammeh, who is currently is in exile in Equatorial Guinea, returns to the country peacefully, with dignity.           What's not clear is whether the MoU protects Jammeh from prosecution given the fact that there's a campaign currently ongoing to bring him to justice on allegations of crimes against humanity.
