Somalia's President Mohamed Farmaajo on September 16, 2021 announced that he suspended his Prime Minister Hussein Roble's powers to hire and fire officials.      The president said the the suspension of these duties will remain in effect until after elections are held.           Abdirashid M Hashi, President Farmaajo's spokesman, said Roble had "not consulted with the president, and proceeded to issue decisions that were inconsistent with the laws and the constitution of the country".  It is now being considered as incompetence on the prime minister's part.           The two leaders also differed following events surrounding the disappearance of Ikran Tahlil, a spy who went missing on June 26, 2021.           Roble suspended Fahad Yasin, director-general of the National Intelligence Security Agency (NISA), but hours later, President Farmaajo overruled Roble and reinstated the spy chief.           The NISA currently has two directors Bashir Mohamed Jama and Yasin Abdullahi Mohamud who were nominated by Prime Minister Roble and President Farmajo. According to the electoral calendar, elections will be conducted until October 10, 2021 but there have been delays on crucial parliamentary polls, suggesting that the finalisation of the schedule may drag on.
