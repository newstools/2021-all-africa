Thousands of protesters, including politicians and civil society players gathered at the Municipal Theatre in Tunis on September 26, 2021 to denounce the exceptional measures decreed on July 25, 2021 and September 22, 2021 by President Kais Saied as a "coup", after he increased his national powers and suspended parliament. Critics are saying this is an attempt by the president to seize all powers. Between three and four thousand protesters according to security sources, called for the president's removal and the "cancellation of the coup, to defend democracy and protect the Constitution." On the opposite side of the Municipal Theatre, hundreds of the president's supporters rallied for the exceptional measures decided by the president, which among others, saw the sacking of Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi with whom he reportedly, had a longstanding feud. Saied called the moves a "national emergency". Tunisia in recent months, has seen the arrest of several people opposed to the president. Tunisias' teetering economy gave rise to the Tunisian Revolution in 2010 - a 28-day campaign of civil resistance and street protests that led to the ouster of then-president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011.
