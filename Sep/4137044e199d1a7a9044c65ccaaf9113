President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced a reshuffle affecting three cabinet secretaries, writes Daily Nation. The president has moved Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa from the Devolution Ministry to Defence, while Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma has been transferred from Defence to Energy. Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter, who headed the Energy Ministry, will now be in charge of the Devolution ministry. Keter's exit from the energy portfolio came hours after President Kenyatta received a report from a presidential taskforce he appointed in March 2021 to review power purchase agreements, and which recommended wide-ranging reforms to bring down the cost of electricity for consumers. Kenyatta's cabinet changes comes at at time when the country prepares for August 2022 general election
