The General Debate at the UN General Assembly opens in New York on September 21, 2021 with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expected to warn of a world and a planet in crisis. The theme for the current session is Building Resilience Through Hope -  to recover from Covid-19, rebuild sustainability, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of people and revitalise the UN." Perhaps the most important topic will be climate change, with new scientific evidence showing a losing battle in what Guterres has called, an existential struggle. Emissions of planet-warming gases could grow by 16% during this decade, compared with 2010 levels - even as the latest scientific research indicates that they must decrease by at least a quarter by 2030 to avert the worst impacts of global warming.
