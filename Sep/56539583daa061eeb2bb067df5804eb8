The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) had renewed MTN Nigeria's operating and spectrum licences for another decade, effective from September 1, 2021 after it  expired on August 31, 2021. The renewal covers the mobile operator's licence of its Unified Access Service and spectrum for wireless local loop in the 900MHz and 1800MHz band, subject to license conditions. The CEO of MTN Nigeria, Karl Toriola said: "Renewing our licences for another ten years is very important to our business and enables us to continue to provide services to ensure the benefits of modern connected life for our people. MTN Nigeria is delighted with its strong partnership with the NCC and looks forward to working closely with the commission and the communications ministry, to accelerate the growth of Nigeria's digital economy." Nigeria is MTN's biggest market, and the company has previously encountered numerous regulatory challenges in the West African country, including a fine in 2015 by the NCC for unregistered SIM card users.
