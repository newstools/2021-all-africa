After last week's triple eviction, Big Brother has increased the tension in the house with a grand total of four evictions. Tega, Boma, Peace, and Michael have been booted out, reducing the number of housemates from 17 to 13. At the last nomination, Big Brother switched things up, announcing that all the housemates would be up for eviction except for Jackie B and Jay Paul, who were winners of the Head of House game and were automatically safe from nomination. BBNaija is scheduled to run for 72 days and will end on October 3, 2021. The reality show has already topped previous seasons as MultiChoice Nigeria announced a grand prize of U.S.$236,000 - the highest in the show's history.
