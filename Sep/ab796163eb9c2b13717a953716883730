Personal protection equipment (PPE) contracts between the Department of Health and service provider Digital Vibes prompted an investigation over the firm's connection to former health minister Zweli Mkhize and his family. Mkhize was placed on special leave by President Cyril Ramaphosa as a result. President Cyril Ramaphosa authorised the publication of the final report  - received from the Special Investigating Unit in July 2021 - into the National Department of Health's awarding of a National Health Insurance media campaign and subsequent Covid-19 communications contracts to Digital Vibes.  Further, Scorpio, the investigative arm of South African publisher Daily Maverick, published a report saying that "following months of investigation", U.S.$45,000 from the department of health's allegedly corrupt communications service provider Digital Vibes contract was used to pay, among others, for a nail bar franchise owned by Sthoko Mkhize, who is married to the former minister's son Dedani.
