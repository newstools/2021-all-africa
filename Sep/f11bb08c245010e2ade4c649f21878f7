Junta chief, Lieutenant-Colonel Mamady Doumbouya has called for an inclusive, four-day conference to prepare the transition back to civilian rule, weeks after a coup that deposed the government of  Alpha Condé.           According to the press release from Doumbouya's National Committee for Rally and Development (CNRD), political party leaders, civil society organisations, diplomats, religious emissaries and even mining operators have been invited to participate.           But a number of opposition party leaders, have expressed doubts about how the talks will be handled. Others are worried that the programme, which gives two-hour slots to each sector over the four-day period is not enough to give serious attention to the issues at hand.           Condé's Rally of the Guinean People (RPG) party, held consultations on September 13, 2021 to determine if they will participate. Condé remains in detention under the junta.           Currently, the transition is uncertain, but there are hopes that this conference will reveal the intentions of Colonel Doumbouya, who has not spoken in public since the coup d'état on September 5, 2021.
