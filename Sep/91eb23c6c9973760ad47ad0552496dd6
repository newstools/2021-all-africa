Friends of the Earth Africa has launched 'A Just Recovery Renewable Energy Plan for Africa' which offers a practical and much-needed opportunity to change the trajectory of energy development, distribution, and access on the African continent. The report stresses the urgency to democratize energy systems, reduce the power of transnational corporations and enable peoples and communities to access sufficient energy to live a dignified life. "It is time for African governments, public and private financial institutions to end their interest and investment in dirty energy in Africa and open the doors further for democratized, low-cost renewable energy accessible to all including women, youth, local communities, and indigenous peoples", said Kwami Kpondzo of Friends of the Earth Togo. The Plan will bring electricity to hundreds of millions and create over 7 million jobs in order to drive a Just Recovery from Covid-19, address climate change and reduce inequality. It includes a political statement that has been signed and endorsed by 50 organizations across the continent - all echoing the demand for clean and affordable energy for hundreds of millions of Africans, that governments must take effective measures to prevent the Corporate Capture of democracy and stresses the possibility of a Just Recovery Renewable Energy Plan for a 100% Renewable Energy in Africa. A report by Friends of the Earth Africa has found that the continent needs about U.S.$130bn in investment a year between now and 2050 to achieve 100% renewable energy supply. This, they say, could be funded through stopping illicit financial flows, providing public climate finance, and the cancellation of Africa's debt.
