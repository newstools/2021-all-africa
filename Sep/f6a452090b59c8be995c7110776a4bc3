The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has reported that at least 480 civilians were killed in militia attacks in Burkina Faso between May and August 2021.           The NRC also expressed alarm at the increase in the number of displaced people in recent months, with more than 275,000 people "forced to flee a new outbreak of violence" since April 2021. In total, more than 1.4 million people have been forced to leave their homes due to the attacks.           The NRC described the "impossible choice of some families to stay in a besieged area where food shortages have become so critica,l that there are only leaves to eat or to walk for days in search of food and risk being attacked."
