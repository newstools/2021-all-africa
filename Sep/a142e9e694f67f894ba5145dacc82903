Zambia's High Commission has confirmed that 200 Tanzania-registered trucks have been seized for illegal logging of protected mukula - a type of rosewood, without valid permits, the Zambian High Commissioner Benson Chali has said. In 2016, Zambia banned the felling and transporting of the timber which is in growing demand of rosewood in Asia. In 2018, Zambia Revenue Authority seized at least 250 trucks that were found carrying the protected timber. Lusaka requires transporters, even those in transit, to have valid documents showing the origin of their rosewood logs, and when they were harvested. Tanzania's High Commissioner to Zambia, Hassan Simba Yahya said that the issue will now be resolved diplomatically by the two countries.
