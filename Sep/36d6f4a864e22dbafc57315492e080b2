Zamfara State government has shut down schools across the state following the abduction of 73 students at the Government Day Secondary School in Kaya in the state. The state government also imposed a 6pm to 6am curfew on 13 local government areas and an 8pm to 6am curfew in Gusau, the state capital, until further notice. Armed groups are blamed for a series of raids on schools in northern Nigeria in recent months, taking more than 1,000 learners since December 2020. The gunmen have demanded large ransom payments from parents, and while most pupils ultimately have been released, some have died or been killed in captivity. Katsina, Niger, Zamfara, and Kaduna have put restrictions in place to stop armed gangs who travel by motorbike and camp out in forests. Restrictions include bans on fuel sales in jerry cans and transporting firewood.
