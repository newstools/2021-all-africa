Since January 2021, the cholera outbreak has killed 2,323 people, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control has said. The public health agency said at least 69,925 suspected cases of cholera infection have been recorded in 25 states and the federal capital of Abuja as of September 5, 2021. Children between 5 and 14 years are the most affected age group, and the overall fatality rate for cholera cases is 3.3%, more than double the 1.3% fatality rate among Covid-19 cases in Nigeria. Cholera is a highly virulent disease characterised by a severe form by a sudden onset of acute watery diarrhea that causes severe dehydration that could lead to death. The outbreak of cholera in Nigeria has remained persistent, occurring annually mostly during the rainy season and more often in areas with poor sanitation, overcrowding, lack of clean food and water, and areas where open defecation is a common practice.  Nigeria also continues to see regular outbreaks of Yellow Fever, Lassa Fever, Measles, and other infectious diseases. The country is still facing a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic mainly driven by the Delta variant, and authorities are intensifying efforts to vaccinate citizens.
