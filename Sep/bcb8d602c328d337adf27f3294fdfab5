Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has thanked the German government for removing South Africa from the Covid-19 red list. This means that the country is no longer deemed a "high risk" nation and that all vaccinated travellers from South Africa can now travel to Germany without the need for an "explanation" for purpose of entry. "This is great news for South Africans who travel for leisure and business. We are looking forward to welcoming back the German tourists to South Africa," said Sisulu. Despite the decision, Africa is still considered a no-go zone for other European nations including the UK. "Many of our nations are on the UK red list of countries to avoid travelling to. The UK itself has a little over 7-million cases. Removing African countries from the red list of European countries is a challenge we should embrace and work steadfastly to bring to an end," Sisulu said. South Africa's tourism industry will have to weather further financial difficulties due to the UK's decision to keep South Africa on its red list. Tourist accommodation income statistics has shown that seasonally adjusted income from accommodation, plunged by 36.8% month-on-month in July 2021, with guesthouses and hotels recording double-digit contractions, wiping out the increase from the first three months of 2021.
