Weeks after Guinea's president Alpha Condè was deposed, coup-plotters have said it would not yield to pressure by the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS), and allow the former leader to leave the country. Ghana's President, Nana Akufo-Addo led a delegation to Conakry to convey the bloc's decision on Guinea to the Military Junta, and demanded Condè immediate release.           The ECOWAS Chair, President Akufo-Addo and President Ouattara, who represented the 15-member of ECOWAS, held separate meetings with Colonel Doumbouya and Conde in Conakry, without much progress. ECOWAS, among others, had demanded the Country's return to constitutional rule after the special military forces seized power, arrested and detained Conde.           The ECOWAS decision came after the military coup sparked condemnation from some world leaders, including regional and continental bodies such as the African Union and the UN.           But back in Guinea, there was jubilation in some parts of the capital, Conakry, where residents took to the streets to praise the soldiers who removed Condè.
