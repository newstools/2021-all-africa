With the Nigerian judiciary refusing to publicly disclose its budgets and financial records, there are speculations that funds meant for repair of court infrastructure, are being drained. Lawyers at the high court in Abuja, are worried that the inadequacy of critical facilities in the courtrooms that disrupt justice dispensation, writes investigative journalist Ameh Ejekwonyilo for Premium Times. Monday Adjeh of the Nigeria Bar Association has said: "the twin problems of lack of functional recording devices and small sizes of courtrooms are major impediments that delay dispensation of justice."  Apart from the lack of these basic facilities, there is also the absence of facilities that allow people with disabilities access to the courts in Abuja and elsewhere around the country. Leaking roofs, poor seating and littered environments, have resulted in court proceedings being unnecessarily delayed. Coupled with this, is the Inadequate water and electricity supply.  Premium Times has sent a letter requesting details of the budgets and other financial records of the court including those related to its ongoing projects.
