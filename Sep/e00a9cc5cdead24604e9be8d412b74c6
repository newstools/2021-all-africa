Barely six months after declaring Zamfara State a 'no-fly zone', the federal government in a renewed effort to fight banditry and other forms of insecurity, has shut down all telecom activities in the state. The shutdown comes as security forces fight to contain armed gangs who have been carrying out killings and kidnappings for ransom, reports Prince Osuagwu for Vanguard.  The Nigerian Communications Commission directed telecoms operators to shut down their sites in Zamfara State, following the mass kidnapping of students in the state. However, some telecoms experts have expressed concern that the measure will affect businesses and communications. They called on the government to devise other means of tracking and arresting kidnappers across the country, reports This Day. The shutdown order will last for two weeks, beginning from September 3, 2021, after which the security situation in the state would be reviewed. Katsina, Niger, Zamfara, and Kaduna have put restrictions in place to stop armed gangs who travel by motorbike and camp out in forests. Restrictions include bans on fuel sales in jerry cans and transporting firewood.
