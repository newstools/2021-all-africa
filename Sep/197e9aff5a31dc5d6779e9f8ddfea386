Ransomware attacks are the fastest growing form of cybercrime in the world, writes Herman Singh for The Conversation. They happen through the infiltration by malicious software of a computer or network. The aim is to limit or restrict access to critical data by encrypting files - effectively locking them - until a ransom is paid. South Africa's Justice and Constitutional Development Department has clarified a report that hackers demanded a U.S.$2.3 million ransom, following a ransomware attack on the department's Information Technology systems. The department says it has not paid the ransom. It says it has meanwhile, recovered some functionality on its MojaPay system which controls its child maintenance payment system. The crash in May impacted over 1,500 recipients, mainly women, from KwaZulu-Natal province and the Eastern Cape province.  Cyber attacks on governmental departments during September 2021 also affected government parastatal Transnet, and the South African National Space Agency.
