It is estimated that more than a million people face hunger in the country's worst drought in decades. An immediate and massive increase in food aid is urgently needed for  the region, says Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). MSF has set up mobile clinics in 17 locations across southern Madagascar. Given the situation, deforestation, sandstorms, etc, providing treatment for malnutrition is just not enough. Food must be distributed too. People in southern Madagascar are experiencing an exceptionally acute food and nutrition crisis that is leaving thousands of children severely ill and pushing entire families into extreme poverty. Since March 2021, MSF emergency teams have been setting up more and more mobile clinics to deliver humanitarian and medical assistance in several districts across the region. They have now begun distributing food and recently opened an inpatient therapeutic feeding centre in the hospital in the town of Ambovombe. "We're seeing malnourished children struggling to regain weight after weeks of treatment in our mobile clinics. The medical care we provide and the half-rations different organisations have been distributing are not enough to reverse the trend in a setting where there is so little access to food. A massive increase in emergency food assistance is an absolute priority," says MSF's head of emergency programmes Bérengère Guais.
