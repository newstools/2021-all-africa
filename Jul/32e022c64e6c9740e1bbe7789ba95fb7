In Nigeria, at least eight hospital staff from the residential quarters of the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Centre in Zaria, Kaduna State, were abducted with their children, by alleged bandits. The bandits stormed the hospital, while also attacking a nearby police station. In a separate incident, an unconfirmed number of students were abducted from Bethel Baptist Secondary School in Kaduna State. This is the third major attack in Kaduna within 24 hours. Efforts have been intensified to rescue the abducted people. Kidnappings for ransom have become rampant in many parts of Nigeria. More than 700 students have been abducted since December 2020.  Some have been freed, while others remain missing.
