Somali Prime Minister Hussein Roble has announced the final timetable for elections, indicating Senate elections will take place from July 25, 2021, followed by that for members of the lower house. Debate has already ensued on the role that clans will play in determining who takes which seat. Somalia had initially planned for universal suffrage, which would have been the first time since 1969. But delays in passing a new Constitution and setting up institutions capable of running those elections, means that cannot happen now. Most analysts think these elections will largely depend on who has money, connections with the federal states and a campaign strategy to sell itself as the best.
