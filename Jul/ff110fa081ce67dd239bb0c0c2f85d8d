The South African National Defence Force has been deployed to areas in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng experiencing civil unrest. The NatJOINTS (National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure) spokesperson, Colonel Brenda Muridili, said Gauteng police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the deaths of four people since the outbreak of violent protests. In KwaZulu-Natal, there were reports of two people who have been killed. "The possibility of criminal charges being brought against such persons cannot be ruled out, particularly in the event of injury or death that may come as a result of any operational response by the security forces to these incidents of violence and opportunistic criminality," NatJOINTS said. Looting and lawbreaking that started in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province after the imprisonment of former president Jacob Zuma spilled over into Gauteng province. The Daily Maverick's Julia Evans reported that protests in Gauteng, ostensibly against Zuma's imprisonment, escalated into criminality, where civilians damaged property and roads, looted businesses and rioted, affecting public transport and power services.
