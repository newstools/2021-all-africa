The Voice Nigeria musical contest has entered its final stage with the top six talents seeking viewers and fans' votes to win. Over fourteen thousand contestants entered the competition, and while some were lucky to get a chair turn from distinguished coaches, others were encouraged to try again, as the journey began for the selected few. The top six who will be battling it out for the coveted prize at the grand finale on July 24, 2021 are KPee and Esther (Team Darey), Kitay (Team Yemi), Naomi Mac, and Dapo (Team Falz); and Eazzie (Team Waje). The winner will take home at least U.S.$24,000 cash, a car, and a record deal with Universal Music Nigeria.
