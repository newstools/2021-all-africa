Parliament on June 30, passed The Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 3) Bill, 2021 to among others, tighten road safety regulations on scooter taxis, commonly known as "bodaboda" operators. In the motion for the amendments of 14 laws, Attorney General Adelardus Kilangi  said: "the government has approved changes in the Road Traffic Act (Cap 10) by increasing the licenced ownership age for an operator from 16 to 18 years, and that licences will only be issued to motorbike riders who have undergone certified driving school training. Before the passing of the Bill, the country did not have specific procedures for "bodabodas". Other changes passed in the Road Traffic Act include the mandatory seat belt rule for all vehicle passengers, helmets for motorbike and pillion riders, and the reduction of the duration which a broken-down vehicle can be left by a roadside - from three days to only 24 hours.
