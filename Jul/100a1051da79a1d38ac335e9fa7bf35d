The High Court in Kampala has issued orders, compelling government to regulate the skyrocketing medical fees currently charged for treating and managing Covid-19 patients. This followed a consent agreement between government representatives and Moses Mulumba, the Executive Director of a Civil Society Organisation (CSO), Center for Health, Human Rights and Development (CEHURD)- that had petitioned court over the exorbitant medical fees. "By consent, this application is therefore determined on the following terms; an order is hereby issued against the respondents to intervene by making regulations on fees chargeable by hospitals on management and treatment of persons suffering from Covid-19," ruled Justice Phillip Odoki. Following the recent second wave of Covid-19, several private hospitals around Kampala city are charging exorbitant medical fees of between U.S.$S845 to S.$2,819 per day in cases of Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Some hospitals had reached an extent of detaining dead bodies of Covid-19 patients until the pending medical bills left behind are cleared. Other hospitals conditioned treatment of Covid-19 patients with demands for collateral security such as car log books and land titles.
