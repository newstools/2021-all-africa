A state-of-the-art multi-million dollar innovation hub that offers a conducive integrated ecosystem for sustainable technology transfer, was launched in Windhoek at the Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST). The High-Tech Transfer Plaza Select (HTTPS), is a result of the partnership between NUST and MTC. Essentially, the centre will primarily facilitate the creation of inventions that are set to contribute to the socio-economic development of the country. NUST Vice-Chancellor, Dr Erold Naomab said the centre is vital for local, regional impact and global recognition. "It is noteworthy that technology transfer usually happens at a smaller sporadic scale within isolated technology transfer or research and innovation offices in universities or the industry. However, what is distinctively different about the HTTPS is the size, the intensity and scale at which technology transfer will happen. Therefore, HTTPS is not an office nor a building but it is an ecosystem that brings various technology actors together irrespective of size or the type of sector," Naomab said.
