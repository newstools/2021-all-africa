Fears are mounting that kidnapping for ransom could trigger terrorism in Benin. This is amid an already growing threat of violent extremism in the country. National authorities and local communities worry that kidnapping could exacerbate Benin's security challenges and provide an entry point for extremists operating nearby. There has been no evidence of kidnappers being linked to violent extremist groups. Still, such incidents could be exploited by terrorists operating in neighbouring countries such as Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria. Extremists are already obtaining logistical and financial resources from West African coastal states, writes Michaël Matongbada for the Institute for Security Studies. Kidnappers are suspected of being from Benin, Burkina Faso, or Nigeria. Perpetrators target mainly wealthy local herders or those involved in large transactions on livestock market days. The kidnappers identify their victims, often with the support of the latter's relatives, friends, or associates. The victims are then kidnapped either on the road or in their homes and held in the forests.
