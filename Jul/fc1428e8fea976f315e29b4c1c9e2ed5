The Senate has passed an Electoral Reform Bill aimed at improving transparency ahead of elections in 2023, but the opposition voiced reservations over how voting results should be communicated. The Bill was read for the third time and passed, amid an uproar. The amended bill now empowers the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the National Assembly "to determine the use (or not) of electronic transmission of results of elections". The Independent National Electoral Commission was also given the power to review results declared by an electoral officer under duress. The country's electoral body, INEC, came under fire after President Muhammadu Buhari's re-election in 2019 over claims that the voting was not free or transparent. The opposition challenged the results in court, in part because of concerns over the legality of the electronic transfer of ballot tallies. Buhari will be stepping down after serving two four-year terms.
