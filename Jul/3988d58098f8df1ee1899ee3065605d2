Scientists and conservationists working to save the northern white rhino from extinction have expressed hope of having the first calf within two years. They are using advanced reproduction technologies to raise the first offspring from nine unique embryos harvested from two surviving northern white rhinos in Kenya. The scientists intend to transfer embryos into surviving southern white rhinos to act as surrogate mothers, paving the way for the birth of a new northern white rhino calf with the gestation of a rhino of 16 months. There are five southern white rhinos in a protected enclosure at Ol Pejeta Conservancy. The enclosure has been kept empty for the purpose of the project.
