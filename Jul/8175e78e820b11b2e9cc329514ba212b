South Sudan marks its 10th anniversary on July 9, 2021 as one of the world's poorest countries with 8 million people, or two thirds of the population, dependent on humanitarian aid. The United Nations Children Fund warns that about 300,000 children under the age of five alone are at risk of starvation. And the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) notes that it has provided surgical care to more than 9,000 weapon-wounded patients since July 2011. In 2020, women and children comprised nearly a quarter of the patients treated by the ICRC.           Deutsche Welle's Cristina Krippahl writes that some experts see little hope for the country as long as the current politicians remain in power. "You should give room to a new crop of leaders who'll reflect with a new mindset the reality and the diversities of a post-conflict South Sudan," Andrews Atta-Asamoah, Senior Researcher at the South African Institute for Security Studies, said. "That is what they really need at the moment."           A statement of congratulations on the 10th anniversary from the "Troika" (United States, United Kingdom, and Norway) says that while the first ten years of the country's history have seen much suffering, " through it all, the South Sudanese people have shown resilience". The Troika says that the great challenge now facing South Sudan is to recapture the sense of unity, strength, and hope that prevailed on July 9 ten years ago.
