Sierra Leone has become the latest country to outlaw the death penalty, after its Parliament approved a Bill replacing relevant sections of the penal code. Until now the death penalty was invoked for four main crimes in the country: murder, robbery with aggravation, mutiny and treason. All these offences are now punishable by life sentences. The Bill needs the assent of President Julius Maada Bio before it becomes law.           The move by parliament marks a fulfilment of a campaign promise by President Bio, as contained in his party's manifesto.
