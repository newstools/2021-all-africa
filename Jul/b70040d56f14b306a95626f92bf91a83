Officials say separatists fighters have started disguising themselves as military troops to infiltrate villages and launch attacks. In a video widely circulated on social media platforms, including Facebook and WhatsApp, a group of 10 men armed with AK-94 assault rifles claim they are separatist fighters. The men, in civilian clothing, appear to brandish Cameroonian military uniforms, guns, ammunition and bulletproof vests they say they seized from Cameroon military. Cameroon's separatists have been fighting since 2017 to create an independent English-speaking state in the majority French-speaking country's western regions. The conflict has cost more than 3,000 lives and forced 550,000 people to flee to French-speaking regions of Cameroon or into neighboring Nigeria, according to the United Nations.
