The Malawian government has finally paid compensation to 18 women and girls who were raped by police officers in the capital Lilongwe during post-election violence in 2018. This comes after the Supreme Court of Malawi ordered that police pays compensation to the survivors.           The survivors have been awarded between U.S.$4,949 and U.S.$12,372, according to Gladys Gondwe, Registrar for the Malawi Supreme Court of appeal and the High Court. Although the decision is seen as a milestone in women's rights in the southern African country, none of the police officers have been charged as yet.
