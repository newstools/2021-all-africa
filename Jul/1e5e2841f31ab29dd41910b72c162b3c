The UK government has asked the Nigeria government to explain where and how Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)  - who holds British citizenship - was arrested. His lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, said that Kanu was detained and mistreated in Kenya before being turned over to Nigerian authorities. Kanu was on the run for four years until he was brought to court in Abuja on June 29, 2021, and told he would stand trial. The Nigerian authorities have refused to confirm where Kanu was arrested, while Kenya's ambassador to Nigeria Tom Amolo, has denied his country was involved. Kanu will face 11 charges that include treason, terrorism, and the illegal possession of firearms.  The Republic of Biafra, was a secessionist state in West Africa, in the eastern region of Nigeria. The Republic was formed as a result of the Igbo people seeking independence from Nigeria. This led to the Nigerian Civil War from 1967 -1970, after the Biafra declared its independence. The Biafra was eventually defeated and Nigeria reunited the two states.
