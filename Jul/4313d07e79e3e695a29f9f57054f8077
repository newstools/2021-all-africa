Malnutrition is one of the world's major public health and development concerns. In Nigeria, the situation is dire. Currently, UNICEF says 5 in 10 children under five years old suffer the effects of being malnourished. This has an overarching impact on the lives, future, and productivity of Nigerian children, writes Ogechi Ekeanyanwu for The Conversation Africa. Prior to the emergence of Covid-19, approximately four in 10 Nigerians were living in extreme poverty based purely on monetary measures. Post-Covid-19, the cost of living has continued to rise, thereby plunging Nigerians deeper into poverty.  In terms of severity - compared to global rates of acute malnutrition - four zones are worst affected: Central Yobe, Northern Yobe, Northern Borno, and East Borno. The levels of malnutrition is worsened by the ongoing conflict in these regions, food insecurity, poor water, and sanitation conditions, high morbidity, and poor infant care.
