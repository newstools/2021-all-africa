A team from the Southern African Development Community will arrive in eSwatini, after the kingdom was rocked by pro-democracy protests and claims of a deadly crackdown, writes Michael Fitzpatrick for Radio France Internationale. The kingdom's government said it had invited the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to carry out "a fact-finding mission". The 16-country bloc added that its team would encourage the kingdom to find a lasting solution to the dispute. The eSwatini government has said it has not received any official reports of fatalities. Internet service providers said they have been ordered to cut access to social media and online platforms until further notice. Demonstrations against the authoritarian monarchy escalated following the shooting of a student in mid-May. Swazi Media Commentary reported that marches took place in at least 10 locations, mainly in rural areas despite a ban placed by the king on pro-democracy demonstrations. Reports indicated that as many as 19 people had reportedly been shot dead, allegedly by the military. The Communist Party of Swaziland said that five people were certified dead at the Mbabane Government Hospital in the Swazi capital. It added that more than 50 people were admitted to the hospital with gunshot wounds.
