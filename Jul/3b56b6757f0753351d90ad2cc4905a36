A bill that would make it a crime to be gay, bisexual or transgender, has shocked the local LGBTIQ+ community and raised fears over a possible surge in discrimination and violence against sexual minorities in Ghana. Gay sex is already punishable with up to three years in jail in Ghana, where homophobic persecution is widespread, but the draft law would go much further - making it illegal to be LGBTIQ+ or advocate for LGBTIQ+ rights, and will impose longer jail sentences. Danny Bediako from Rightify Ghana, a local LGBTIQ+ group said: "this bill is a homophobe's dream law. The community is shocked at how wide-ranging it is. People are even scared to go out now and some members say they will leave the country if the bill is passed into law. Even those who want to help us will be afraid," he added.  If approved, the legislation would make it a crime punishable with up to five years imprisonment to be gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, pansexual and non-binary - someone who does not identify as male or female.
