Many Muslim Nigerians are celebrating Eid-el-Kabir amid tougher economic times and security concerns. Some traders and buyers are bemoaning the high cost of foodstuff including rams. President Muhammadu Buhari has warned that taking advantage of the Eid celebration to exploit fellow citizens through outrageous prices, is inconsistent with the virtues of Islam. Buhari, in a message to mark Eid-el-Kabir, urged Nigerians to team up with his administration in battling the security crisis facing the country by exposing sponsors of insecurity. He also stressed the need for Muslims to live in harmony with other faiths, while praying for the progress of the country. Buhari said his administration is working hard to address food inflation worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of flooding on agricultural activities in the country. Across the world, Muslims will celebrate the feast of Eid-el-Kabir or the feast of sacrifice. It is also called Eid al-Adha. The festival, regarded as one of the most important feasts in the Islamic Calendar, is usually celebrated with prayers, charity, love, and sharing of gifts with friends. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and other health authorities have advised Nigerians to be cautious during the Sallah celebrations. The country is on the verge of the third wave of the outbreak. Thus far, Nigeria has vaccinated over one million people. There are at least 169,678 confirmed Covid-19 cases, 164,720 recoveries, and over 2,128 fatalities.
