The Rugby Africa Cup is an annual rugby union tournament involving African nations, organised by Rugby Africa.  Despite the challenges of Covid-19 and travel restrictions, 13 top African rugby teams have been competing through more than a month of on-field competition in the 2021-2022 tournament which ended on July 22, 2021 in Harare, Zimbabwe. The tournament which doubles as a qualifier for the 2023 Rugby World Cup, began on June 5, 2021, where teams were competing for one direct qualification spot into the final World Cup tournament and for one place in the final qualification tournament. The President at Rugby Africa, Khaled Babbou said: "Despite the challenges it was great to see all unions and administrators pull together to run a smooth game and keep the integrity of the qualifying process, where all eligible rugby unions were offered a chance to compete, despite some unions being unable to participate, it was a remarkable achievement. Botswana, Rwanda, Mauritius, eSwatini and Tunisia declined to enter the competition due to on-going Covid-19 restrictions hampering their teams' preparation, while Morocco and Nigeria rugby unions are currently suspended", Babbou said.
