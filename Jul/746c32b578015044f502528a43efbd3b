The South African government has said it is "appalled" at the decision of the African Union Commission (AUC) to grant Israel observer status in the African Union (AU). "The AU Commission has taken this decision unilaterally without consultations with its members. The decision to grant Israel observer status is even more shocking in a year in which the oppressed people of Palestine were hounded by destructive bombardments and continued illegal settlements of the land," the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) statement read. The South African government has slammed Israel's apartheid on the Palestinian people on several occassions, most recently after a series of deadly airstrikes targetting the Gaza strip during May 2021. "The vicious attacks by Israel on Palestinian people and the forced removal of Palestinians from their homes is clear evidence of the absence of peace and security for millions worldwide ... We call on the UN and the Gulf Council to be more resolute in pursuing freedom for the people of Palestine," International Relations and Cooperation Minister, Naledi Pandor said at the time.
