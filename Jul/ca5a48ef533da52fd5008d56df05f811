Bintou Keita, the Secretary-General's Special Representative and head of the UN Stabilization Mission in the DR Congo, has told the Security Council that a new government action plan in the country, has the potential to reverse the urgent and tragic deterioration in the eastern region, where thousands of human rights abuses are being committed against civilians by armed militants. Describing recent political developments, Keita said a new coalition government, the Union Sacrée de la Nation, recently took power, with Prime Minister Jean-Michel Sama Lukonde Kyenge inaugurated on April 26, 2021. Noting the recent declaration of a "state of siege" in Ituri and North Kivu provinces - where violence by armed groups has been among the worst in the country - she welcomed commitments by the new government to improve civilian protection, combat those perpetrating crimes against them, and hold national and local elections in 2023. In particular, Keita drew the council's attention to an action plan recently released by the new government, which aims to neutralize violent armed groups. It also includes a new programme for the disarmament, demobilisation, community reintegration and stabilisation of former armed groups.
