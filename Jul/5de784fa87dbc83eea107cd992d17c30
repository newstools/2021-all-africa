The government has selected four asset managers to run the U.S.$37 billion funds set up to drive investment in roads, railways, and power projects in Nigeria. The pool of funds by a private sector-led infrastructure company, Infra-Co, was established for the construction of critical projects to help accelerate growth in the country. The selected asset managers include Netherlands-based Sanlam Infraworks; AIIM, a unit of South Africa's Old Mutual Group; Lagos-based Chapel Hill Denham; and Triple A, a consortium comprising AfricaPlus Partners and Arc Asset Management as well as Afrinvest West Africa, a Nigerian investment bank. According to Central Bank Governor Godwin Emefiele, the infrastructure corporation is expected to begin full operation by the third quarter of 2021. In February 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari approved U.S.$2.4 billion for Infra-Co to help close the huge infrastructure deficit in the country. The president also said that Nigeria loses U.S.$26.6 billion annually to piracy and sea robbery - this was disclosed while he commissioned the Falcon Eye system to boost maritime security.
