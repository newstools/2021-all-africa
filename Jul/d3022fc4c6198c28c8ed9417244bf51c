Insecurity and conflict have plagued north-east Nigeria for almost 12 years, causing millions of people to feel the pain of hunger. Covid-19 has only exacerbated the situation, causing economic shocks that have affected families' ability to access or purchase food. The UN and its humanitarian partners are working around the clock to ensure that families have enough food to survive.  Despite enormous risks to their safety, the UN and its partners continue to find ways to deliver aid and food assistance through a process called "localization." Localization allows partners and agencies to work with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to deliver humanitarian aid and assistance to unreached communities constantly under threat of violence from armed groups. This process allows for local solutions to local problems.  Security and access to affected communities are crucial to ensure the principled delivery of humanitarian aid. There is no humanitarian solution to what is happening to millions of people in north-east Nigeria; peace is the only solution, writes Adedeji Ademigbuji for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
