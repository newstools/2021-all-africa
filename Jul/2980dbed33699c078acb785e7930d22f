Authorities in Madagascar have arrested several people they believe were part of a plot to kill President Andry Rajoelina. The attorney general's office issued a statement on Thursday saying the suspects were part of a conspiracy to undermine the island nation's security, including "the elimination and neutralization" of a number of people. Two Frenchmen were among several people arrested. It's understood the men, named as dual Franco-Malagasy national Paul Rafanoharana and Frenchman Philippe François, have been charged with undermining state security. One of the poorest countries in the world, Madagascar has experienced many serious political crises over the past 20 years. The island has been under virtual lockdown since the Covid-19 pandemic, and famine is gripping the country's south.
