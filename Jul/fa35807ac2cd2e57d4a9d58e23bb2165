Rwanda has reportedly passed a new order that legalises medical use of Cannabis, also known as marijuana, as the country moves closer to mass production and export of the multi-billion-dollar cash crop. The consumption of marijuana products for recreational purposes however, remains illegal in Rwanda. The country maintains harsh penalties for illegal production, distribution and consumption of the herb.  Malawi's Cannabis Regulatory Authority is calling for the creation of structured markets for cannabis growers in that country. The board is also calling for universities and research institutes to start working on the local variety to see how effective it could be, since it would be in the same family of medicinal hemp. In South Africa the use, possession and cultivation of the plant is set to be decriminalised. Nigeria is also considering legalisation, however there is also fierce opposition to a law change there.
