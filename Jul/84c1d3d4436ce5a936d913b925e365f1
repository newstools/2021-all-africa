The East African Court of Justice has struck out a case in which five Kenyans sued the Ugandan government, the East African Community Secretary General and the Lake Victoria Basin Commission, for not managing the outflows of water from Lake Victoria. This caused flooding that displaced over 50,000 people on the lake basin, damaging their property. The case, first filed in May 2020 by the five lawyers, argued that Uganda is greatly impacting the lake by releasing more water than is allowed by a legal agreement between Kampala and Egypt. The rise of water levels in Lake Victoria destroyed several roads, hotels, and houses constructed near the lake.
