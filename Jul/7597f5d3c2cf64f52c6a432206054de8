The handing over of the final report of the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission has been postponed to September 30. Meanwhile, the Commission has clarified what it spent in reparations up to now. And the budget that is still missing. Since it created a reparations fund, the TRRC has received US$1 million from the government. This was part of monies recovered from sales of former leader Yahya Jammeh's assets, although no further details were disclosed. The government promised to pay another US$1 million but that did not materialise. Part of this reparations fund has already been spent on emergency payments while public hearings were still ongoing. Justice Minister Jallow assures the government's strong commitment to implementing the recommendations of the Commission. But rights activist Madi Jobarteh is more pessimistic: "I have little hope that the government will meet its obligations to survivors. Since the launch of the transitional justice program by the president himself in 2017, it is unfortunate that he has not shown the necessary political will and commitment." "What this means is that civil society and the international community should become more vigilant to put pressure on the government to fulfil its obligations," Jobarteh said.
