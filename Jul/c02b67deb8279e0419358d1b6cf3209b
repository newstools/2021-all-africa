Nigeria's airforce spokesperson Edward Gabkwet said in a statement that one of the army's fighter planes was returning from a successful air interdiction mission on July 18, 2021, when it "came under intense enemy fire" which led to the crash in Zamfara State. Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, the pilot of the ill-fated aircraft, escaped successfully, Gabkwet said.  According to an eyewitness, the plane was allegedly brought down by an armed gang. The pilot fled into the neighbouring community.  This is the fourth crash of a military plane in seven months. In April 2021 a Nigerian Airforce fighter jet was declared missing and suspected to have crashed. While Boko Haram claimed to have shot it down, the military denied the claims.
