Conservationists, civil society and human rights advocates have demanded a swift investigation into the murder of prominent environmentalist Joanna Stutchbury - warning that more deaths would follow if activists continued to be attacked with impunity. The group is calling on the environment ministry and the Kenya Forestry Service to come up with a plan and where appropriate, "gazette all forest lands in Kenya to shield them from land grabbers who see the forests as opportunities to enrich themselves at the expense of our environment and all Kenyans". The vocal environmentalist, known for fighting for Kiambu forest which is under constant threat from private developers was killed at her home in Thindigua, Kiambu County.
