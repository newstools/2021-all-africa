The government has put six states on "red alert" after seeing a rise in Covid-19 infections. The head of the presidential steering committee on Covid-19, Boss Mustapha, said Lagos, Oyo, Rivers, Kaduna, Kano, Plateau, and the Federal Capital Territory had been placed on red alert as part of preventive measures against the pandemic. Mustapha said there was the potential for a wider spread of the novel coronavirus during the Eid-el-Kabir gatherings. He urged people to curb gatherings and hold prayers outside mosques during this week's Muslim festival. He also suspended Durbar, an annual Muslim festival in northern Nigeria, which is marked by colourful horse riding events. According to WHO, Africa is witnessing the fastest surge ever in Covid-19 as cases have risen for eight consecutive weeks, topping six million as of July 13, 2021. The country has over one million people vaccinated. Nigeria has recorded at least 169,532 confirmed Covid-19 cases, 164,699 recoveries, and over 2,127 fatalities.
