The novel coronavirus pandemic has all but crippled the tourism sector. But vaccines offer hope for the industry. Its recovery must begin with domestic tourism which is critical in paving the way for international tourism, writes Tafadzwa Matiza for The Conversation. Heightened perceived risk triggers feelings of anxiety and apprehension associated with travel and tourism. This affects the brand image of the crisis-affected countries and influences tourists' decision-making. As a result, tourists delay their trips and change their choice of destination. In some cases, they cancel their planned tourist activity. Even though parts of the global tourism sector have started recovering from Covid-19 restrictions, tourists may still feel that home is safer than abroad.
