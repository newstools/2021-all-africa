The African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved two grants worth U.S.$83.6 million which enable the neighbouring countries to proceed with the construction of a second power transmission line which will eventually boost their energy trade, after enjoying the returns from the first project that linked their power grids. The Board of Directors of the African Development Bank Group approved the funds in a bid to boost cross-border trade in electricity between Ethiopia and Djibouti, according to a statement issued by the bank. The Ethiopia-Djibouti Second Power Interconnection project, according to the bank, will entail the construction of nearly 300 km of interconnector line, 170 km of transmission lines, and new construction or renovation of substations in the two countries.
