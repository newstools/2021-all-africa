President Roch Kabore has fired Cherif Sy in the wake of widespread protests against insecurity on June 26, 2021. At the beginning of June, Burkina Faso saw its worst terror attack on civilians since the conflict with armed groups linked to Al Qaeda and Islamic State (ISIS) began in 2015. Sy was at the helm of the defence ministry since then.           At least 138 people were killed in the village of Solhan. The attack triggered a wave of protests against insecurity.           His replacement is the president himself, along with a minister delegate, Colonel Major Aimé Simpore, who has been appointed to assist. Sy's dismissal was one of the protesters' major demands.
