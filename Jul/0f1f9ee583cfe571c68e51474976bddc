Somali militant group Al-Shabaab has threatened to attack electoral delegates who will be choosing lawmakers in parliamentary elections. The leader of the group, Ahmed Abu Ubaidah, said they are opposed to the poll process and threatened the electoral delegates. Ubaidah urged delegates to reconsider their decision to participate in this year's election, adding that those who defy Al-Shabaab will not be safe.           Abdisalam Gulaid, the former deputy director of Somali Intelligence Agency NISA, said this latest threat is aimed to create climate of fear among those involved in the polls. He said the new threats should not be taken lightly, stressing that there is a need for a coordinated response. The polls begin on July 25, 2021 with Somalia's influential clans electing 54 members of the upper house of parliament.           Meanwhile, The Pentagon has confirmed that U.S. forces were behind the single strike near Galkayo, about 580 kilometers north of the capital of Mogadishu. The airstrike targeting the militant group, is the first such strike in six months, and the first carried out since U.S. President Joe Biden took office. The U.S. carried out 63 airstrikes against Al-Shabaab in 2019 and 53 airstrikes in 2020. Another seven airstrikes were launched in the first two-and-a-half weeks of 2021, before president Donald Trump left office.
