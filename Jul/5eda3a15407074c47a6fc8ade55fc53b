A bridge over Tekeze River, which has been a crucial gateway to supplying aid to many parts of Tigray region, has been destroyed, cutting off people from family, food, medicine and fuel, according to various aid agencies in the region.           This comes at a time when UN agencies have issued stern warnings over the humanitarian crisis and challenges in delivering aid to where it is needed.           The US Federal Aviation Authority has also directed aircraft flying over Ethiopia to either avoid Tigray region or maintain a high altitude.           It is not yet known who is responsible for the blast, but it comes after the recent ceasefire announced by the federal government, and opposition forces re-entering the regional capital Mekelle.
