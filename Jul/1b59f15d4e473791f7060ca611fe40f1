In a finding that may help further reduce side effects, new research has found that the dosage of the drug linezolid can be lowered without compromising how well it works. Together with another drug called bedaquiline, linezolid has been responsible for much of the recent progress in developing treatment for drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis (DR-TB), write Tiyese Jeranji and Marcus Low for Spotlight. Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend a "short" regimen of nine to 11 months for uncomplicated forms of DR-TB. This short regimen includes bedaquiline, but not linezolid. For more complicated or more drug-resistant forms of TB, the WHO recommends a "long" regimen of 18 to 20 months. Though the exact composition of such longer regimens varies, they typically include both bedaquiline and linezolid as part of a regimen comprising at least four different drugs. Linezolid is also included in both South Africa's shorter and longer regimens for various forms of DR-TB.
