The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) will provide funding for Guinea and Tanzania small-scale farmers. In the Republic of Guinea the grant will improve the resilience of more than 2,123 poor farming households trying to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, by ensuring rapid access to inputs, information, markets and cash. In Tanzania 6,240 vulnerable small-scale farmers in rural Tanzania will benefit from the grant. Despite its rich natural resources, Guinea is among the poorest countries in Africa. Low agricultural productivity, lack of wage employment, lack of access to financial services and poor rural infrastructure are all factors. Guinean agriculture consists mainly of family farming focusing on food crops, mainly cereals (rice and maize), tubers and palm oil. The agriculture sector accounts for 20% of GDP.                In Tanzania, growth in the agricultural sector was projected to decline from 5% in 2019 to 2% in 2020 due to the recent locust infestation and the COVID-19 pandemic. Through its Rural Poor Stimulus Facility (RPSF), IFAD will provide U.S.$882,841 as part of its COVID-19 response. At this time when the COVID-19 crisis threatens to push another 500,000 Tanzanians into poverty, the grant aims to minimize the impact on livelihoods, resilience and food security. It will target farmers - half of whom will be women and 30% youth.
