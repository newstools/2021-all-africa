Since the beginning of 2021, at least 11,000 suspected cholera cases have been reported. The most affected states are Plateau, Bauchi, Gombe, Kano, Zamfara, Bayelsa, and Kaduna. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said that a total of 289 Nigerians have died from the disease between January and June 2021.  Cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by the Vibrio cholerae bacillus. The disease spreads through contaminated food and water, reappearing periodically in countries unable to secure access to clean drinking water and adequate sanitation. It can kill within hours if not promptly treated. The NCDC continues to advocate for improved access to clean water, proper sanitation, and hygiene.
