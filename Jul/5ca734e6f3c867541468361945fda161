The Global Fund says Kenya risks losing over U.S.$445 million aimed at boosting the fight against HIV, tuberculosis and malaria in the country, if corruption allegations at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) are not completed and changes made to ensure transparency. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission began investigating allegations of graft at Kemsa in 2020 over the procurement and supply of Covid-19 equipment. The agency cited an "irregular expenditure" of U.S.$72 million. To continue receiving grants, Kemsa is expected to finish implementation of reforms so that they can make urgent interventions, including addressing recent disruptions in the supply of critical HIV drugs.
