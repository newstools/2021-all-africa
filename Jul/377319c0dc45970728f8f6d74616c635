Bandits who raided a boarding school in Kaduna State have released 28 learners but another 81 still remain in their clutches, according to a pastor, Joseph Hayab, who is involved in the negotiations for their release. The attackers stormed Bethel Baptist High School on July 5, 2021 taking learners who were sleeping in their dormitories. It is unclear whether a ransom was paid for their release , even though the bandits had asked the school for food and a ransom to free the hostages. The released learners were reunited with their parents. Kidnappings for ransom have become rampant in many parts of Nigeria. More than 700 students have been abducted since December 2020. Some have been freed, while others remain missing. President Muhammadu Buhari, who is under fire for growing insecurity in the country, has ordered that security forces ensure the safe, early release of all kidnap victims.
