The death toll from the Siaya fuel tanker tragedy has reportedly risen to 17, as the identification of 13 bodies that were burnt beyond recognition began on July 20, 2021. The tragedy occurred when a fuel tanker collided with a lorry transporting milk at Malanga market, Gem Constituency, and burst into flames on July 17, 2021. The crash attracted the attention of the villagers, who rushed to scene to rescue drivers of both vehicles who narrowly escaped death. But what was initially a rescue mission turned into a looting spree as boda boda riders and some villagers started delivering jerrycans to siphon petrol from the overturned tanker. The tanker shortly burst into a huge fireball, engulfing the entire scene, trapping the villagers.
