Coffee societies have reportedly been delivering small batches of the produce to factories due to fear of theft, affecting auction at the Nairobi exchange. The Nairobi Coffee Exchange says five millers that had been issued with trading licenses by the Capital Markets Authority had not submitted samples for sale. In the last six months, four factories have lost more than 360 bags of coffee valued at about U.S.$53,600 according to Meru County Commissioner, Ngumo Karuku.  Police suspect that insiders, such as workers and management, collude with criminals to steal the coffee before it is delivered to millers. Most of the theft reportedly happens after stakeholders meet and settle on when to deliver the coffee to a miller.
