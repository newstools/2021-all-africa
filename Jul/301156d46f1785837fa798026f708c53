Hundreds of civilians have reportedly fled Sagme, a northern village on the border with Nigeria, after a Boko Haram attack on July 24, 2021 that left eight soldiers dead and 13 wounded, according to a press release. The military said that approximately 90 heavily armed militants transported on six military tactical vehicles and several motorcycles, entered the country from Nigeria, launching an attack on Sagme village, located in Cameroon's far north region. Sagma shares a border with Nigeria's Borno State, an area which is said to be an epicentre of militant attacks.           Boko Haram has been fighting for 11 years to create an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria. The fighting has spread to Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Benin, with regular killings, burnings of mosques, churches, markets and schools, and attacks on military installations. The UN has said that Boko Haram violence has killed 30,000 people and displaced about two million in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad.
