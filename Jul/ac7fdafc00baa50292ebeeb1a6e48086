1,649 members of the Shona community, who had been stateless, have been presented with citizenship certificates. In 2016, 1,496 members of the Makonde community in Kwale County were granted citizenship. In 2020, 2,970 stateless Shona and Rwandans received recognition as citizens, in line with the Constitution, which obliges the state to confer citizenship on stateless persons. The Shona community hails from Zimbabwe, most of them having arrived in Kenya as missionaries and their quest for citizenship has lasted for years. Rwandans whose parents came to Kenya to work as slaves for the British colonial government now also want to be recognised as Kenya's 44th tribe.
