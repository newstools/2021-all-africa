Botswana has sent troops to Mozambique, becoming one of  the first countries of the 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) to dispatch soldiers to help fight the insurgency in northern Cabo Delgado province. More troops are expected from other SADC member countries, including Tanzania and Angola, according Mozambique's defence ministry. Meanwhile, the World Food Program has warned of a growing hunger crisis, saying nearly 1 million people need food aid as a result of the conflict. The insurgency started in 2017 and has grown rapidly in the past year. The militants have held the port of Mocimboa da Praia for nearly a year and have repeatedly attacked the strategic centre of Palma, forcing the French energy firm Total to suspend its U.S.$20 billion liquified natural gas project there.
