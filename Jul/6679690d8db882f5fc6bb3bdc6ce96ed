The White House says the Biden administration will donate approximately 25 million COVID-19 vaccines to be distributed in Africa. Shipments are planned in the next few days of one million doses of the Johnson & Johnson one-shot vaccine to Burkina Faso, Djibouti and Ethiopia. In the coming weeks, U.S. officials say, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna or Pfizer vaccines will be made available to 49 African countries. The administration says the government has collaborated fully with the  African Union, the Africa Centres for Disease Control (Africa CDC), the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust, the Afreximbank as well as the Covax collaborative for equitable vaccine distribution, which is co-led by the World Health Organization [@WHO] and the Gavi vaccine alliance.
