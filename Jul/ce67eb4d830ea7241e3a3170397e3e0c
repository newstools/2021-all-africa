Sheep and goats in southwest Nigeria are carrying bacteria that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics. This is a problem because the bacterium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, poses a potential health risk to the owners as well as to the general population. Sheep and goats are important in Nigeria as sources of meat and milk. They are also household assets. They contribute about 35% of the total meat consumed in Nigeria. Goat milk is also consumed in some parts of Nigeria, especially Borno State in the northeast. People can be infected if they come into direct contact with animals carrying it, or materials contaminated with it - leading to severe infections like food poisoning, writes Ezekiel Omoshaba for The Conversation.
