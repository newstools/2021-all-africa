Severe hunger caused by climate change continues to affect southern Madagascar, writes Shelley Thakral for the World Food Programme. People are living through the worst drought in 40 years, which has caused an almost total disappearance of food sources. In recent months, for the first time in the country, pockets of Phase 5, or "Catastrophe" food insecurity on the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification have been recorded. At least 1.14 million people in the Grand Sud need emergency food and nutrition assistance and have been suffering from hunger since the start of the lean season that began in September 2020.
