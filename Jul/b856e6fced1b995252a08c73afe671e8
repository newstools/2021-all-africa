Equatorial Guinea has announced that it will close its London embassy after the UK sanctioned Vice President Téodore Obiang, 53, the son of President Theodoro Obiang, for alleged corruption. The UK government alleges that the younger Obiang misappropriated more than €425 million ($500 million), spending it on mansions, private jets and a €233,000 ($275,000) glove covered in crystals that Michael Jackson wore during his 1987-89 "Bad" tour. Obiang's assets were frozen and he is barred from entering the UK. Téodore, is also responsible for Equatorial Guinea's defence and security. His father, President Theodoro Obiang, 79, is the longest sitting president in the world and the dynastic leader stands accused of a litany of rights abuses.
