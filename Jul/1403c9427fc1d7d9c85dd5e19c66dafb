Olubunmj Agbato is the Chief Executive Officer of B-Spice Fish (a subsidiary of Bspice products and services limited) in Oyo State, Nigeria. Her business processes fish into 10 products which has attracted international grants to her business. Highlighting women in agriculture, Nigeria's Premium Times spoke to Agbato where she shared her experiences. She has a fish farm comprising six ponds. Agbato studied Aquaculture and Fishery Management and started her fish farming business in 2017.           Associations have helped and informed a good number of farmers in Nigeria, and Agbato is a member of the Fish Farmers Organisation of Nigeria (FFON) and also the Fishery Society of Nigeria (FSN). While the capital for the business was from her own pocket, in 2020 she received funding from an international organisation. She says what attracted this international organisation was the creativity of her business. She says that with the catfish farming, her business has about 10 other products, including fish powder which can be included in baby food to increase their nutrition, fish pellets, fish oil, fish cake, fish cookies, etc. "Those actually leave a way for us in the market because people could find something different than the regular fish processors", she said.
