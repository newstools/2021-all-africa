Despite Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed withdrawing federal troops from Mekelle and declaring a unilateral ceasefire on 28 June, Tigray has remained under siege on all sides. Up to 900,000 people are facing famine, and humanitarian supplies are restricted due to a lack of fuel and a shutdown of telecommunications and electricity. Though Mekelle's residents embraced the temporary reprieve from war, cheering and setting alight fireworks, as Tigray regional fighters were met with hugs and kisses. Tigrayans living elsewhere in Ethiopia, fear becoming "The Next Rwanda". Hate speech and targeting of Tigrayans is escalating in Addis Ababa, are terrifying some who are planning to flee. Since November 2020, Tigrayans in Ethiopian cities, especially the capital Addis Ababa, have been arrested by the thousands, had bank accounts temporarily frozen, been purged from their jobs, and had businesses shut down. Tigrayans, a minority ethnic group who make up about 6% of the Ethiopian population, have also been prevented from travelling abroad.      Now, Tigrayan residents in Addis Ababa say that racial profiling has escalated to an alarming degree since the Tigray People's Liberation Front regained ground, with many Tigrayans too fearful to leave their homes. Mass arrests have resumed, along with scores of Tigrayan businesses being forcibly closed by Ethiopian authorities, writes Jaclynn Ashly for African Arguments.
