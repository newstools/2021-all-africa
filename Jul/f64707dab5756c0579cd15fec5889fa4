Nigeria's transport network is largely in a state of disrepair due to inadequate investment over the decades, economic and population growth, and ineffective policies and plans. For instance, Tin Can and Apapa ports in Lagos continue to suffer from inadequate cargo handling equipment. This results in expensive delays. And when goods are eventually cleared, absence of rail connectivity results in them having to be hauled over poor and congested roads to the northern and eastern parts of the country. These factors often result in accidents, breakdowns, and further delays. All are detrimental to the economy, writes Richard Oloruntoba for The Conversation.  Nigeria connects to the global and regional economy through international maritime shipping and air while its internal connections are mostly by road and rail movements. Given this, any freight logistics plan for the country must be seen as part of a global supply chain network.
