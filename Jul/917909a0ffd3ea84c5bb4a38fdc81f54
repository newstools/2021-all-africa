Nigeria, like many low and middle-income countries accounts for some of the highest burdens of maternal deaths. Nigeria accounts for about 20% of global maternal deaths, largely affecting women aged 15-19. The most common causes of maternal deaths in Nigeria are postpartum haemorrghage, sepsis (infections), and high blood pressure during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia and eclampsia). However, postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal deaths accounting for about 25% of all maternal deaths in Nigeria.  This is critical to note since clearly, the quality of maternal health medicines has an important impact on quality of care which pregnant women receive. This quality of care is also directly linked to Nigeria's maternal health outcomes which sadly still rank as one of the worst in the world, with one of the highest rates of maternal and infant deaths.
