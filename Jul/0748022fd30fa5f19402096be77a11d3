As armed Zulu regiments marched alongside Jacob Zuma at his homestead in Nkandla, legal minds elsewhere were somewhat flummoxed following the former president's challenge to a ruling from the highest court in the land, write Des Erasmus and Lwazi Hlangu for Daily Maverick. The Constitutional Court had agreed earlier on Saturday to hear Jacob Zuma's application for rescinding of its judgment, wherein he was sentenced to 15 months' direct imprisonment for contempt of court. The matter has been set down for hearing on July, 12, 2021. The apex court, in a majority judgment, found Zuma guilty of contempt for disobeying its order earlier in the year that he appear before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, chaired by now Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, to answer allegations from scores of witnesses about his role in State Capture.
