The success of a project by 14Trees - a joint venture between Swiss cement manufacturer LafargeHolcim and British development finance agency CDC Group - has shown how 3D printing could be transformative in Africa, where there is a dire shortage of classroom space. The U.N. children's agency UNICEF estimates there is a shortfall of 36,000 primary school classrooms in Malawi alone, a gap that Francois Perrot, 14Trees managing director, estimates could be closed in 10 years using 3D-printing technology. Large-scale 3D printing is gaining steam around the world, with some projects producing a home in just 24 hours of printing time for a few thousand dollars.
