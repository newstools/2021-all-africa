This year, in honour of the holy month of Ramadan, international multi-asset broker Exness held an exclusive trading campaign, where the theme was for traders to raise money for charity through their trading activities. For each trade, Exness gave back a token of appreciation to its clients which also translated to funds being raised for a charitable cause.
