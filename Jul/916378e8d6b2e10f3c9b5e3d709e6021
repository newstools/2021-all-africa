Labour Minister Simon Chelugui has told parliament that 93 Kenyans have died in the Middle East in the past three years. According to the minister, his department is unable to provide a detailed breakdown of the deaths, which occurred mainly in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The Kenyan government has reportedly entered into three bilateral labour agreements with the the three middle eastern nations, in a bid to protect Kenyans working there. According to Chelugui, a draft labour migration management bill and a migrant workers welfare fund will be established, following a cabinet directive, to protect migrant workers.
