Ethiopia's ruling Prosperity Party has been declared the winner of June's national election in a landslide, assuring a second five-year term for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. The election marked the first time Abiy faced voters since he was appointed prime minister in 2018 following several years of anti-government protests. But an opposition boycott, war in the northern region of Tigray, ethnic violence and logistical challenges in some areas overshadowed the poll.
