Art Melody, who raps in the local Djula and Moore languages, knows from experience the negative impact of climate change on farm production, because he is a farmer himself. His songs convey the fear and emotion felt by millions of people across the region because of the impact of global warming.  Art Melody says his grandparents have told him the rainy season used to start in April but now can start in July, so there is less rain and more heat. The U.N. says the impact of desertification and drought, is one of several factors causing the Sahel conflict in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Conflicts often arise between ethnic groups that traditionally grow crops and those that herd livestock, since land usually cannot be used for both purposes. As for Art Melody, his songs attempt to raise awareness of the plight of farmers because, he says, if people's eyes are closed, they will always end up destroying everything, whether it is plants or human relationships.
