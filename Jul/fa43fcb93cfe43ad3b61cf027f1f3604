The latest Quarterly Employment Survey has found that the total number of people employed in South Africa fell by more than 500,000 between March 2020 and March 2021. Total employment is down by 522,000, or 5.4%, on a year-on-year basis. Full-time employment over the same period fell by 599,000 or 6.5%. Renewed lockdown Level 4 restrictions are expected to raise figures, Employment and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi has expressed concern at the statistics. "One of the most concerning areas was in the youth category which remains the most vulnerable in the South African labour market. "For instance, 32.4% of the 10.2 million youth (15-24 years) reported not to be in employment, education or training (NEET) in quarter one of 2021. It constituted 29.6% of NEET in December 2020. Nevertheless, the NEET rate for females was higher than that of their male counterparts in both quarters."
