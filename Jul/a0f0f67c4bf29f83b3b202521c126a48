The popular Instagram celebrity Ramon Abass, popularly known as Hushpuppi, has finally agreed to plead guilty to the multi-million-dollar fraud charges filed against him by the U.S. government. Hushpuppi participated in scams that resulted in losses of U.S.$24 million to the victims. He was arrested in Dubai in June 2020 alongside 12 other people who were part of the scam. The Dubai police later handed them over to the FBI in the U.S., where he was arraigned on charges of conspiracy to launder money,  among others. Despite pleading guilty, Hushpuppi will also be making full restitution on the proceeds of his crime. Hushpuppi has over 2.5 million followers on Instagram where he built a global following by posting pictures of his lavish spending on cars, watches, designer clothes, and private jets.
