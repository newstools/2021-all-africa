The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture - a public inquiry launched by the government of former president Jacob Zuma, in January 2018, to "investigate allegations of state capture, corruption, fraud and other allegations in the public sector including organs of state"- has cost South Africa almost U.S.$70 million (R1 billion), but it has saved the country billions more, said Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo at a media briefing. "(Ultimately), the commission's work can't be measured in rands and cents," Zondo said, adding that it had to be measured by a more substantive outcome. "(We have) to make sure looting doesn't happen again. If the looting repeats itself, it would be a serious indictment on us as a country." The commission's secretary, Professor Itumeleng Mosala, said the commission's work had exposed the theft of many billions more. Zondo said the commission would hand over a final report to President Cyril Ramaphosa by the end of August or the end of September 2021 at the latest.
