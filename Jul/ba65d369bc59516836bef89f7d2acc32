The High Court has reportedly warned the police against unlawful or arbitrary arrests of suspects as a starting point for investigations. Justice Reuben Nyakundi has ruled that it's a breach of the law to take people into custody, then begin looking for evidence. He said this illegal act is witnessed in courts by the many applications for further detentions to gather evidence against suspects. Police are supposed to gather evidence on a suspected offence committed, then arrest the perpetrators, but not arrest and start looking for evidence against them, according to the court.
