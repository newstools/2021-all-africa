President Kais Saied has sacked Hicham Mechichi as prime minister after violent protests. The dismissal comes after thousands of Tunisians took to the streets on July 25, 2021 in anti-government protests that turned violent. The president also announced the freezing of Tunisia's parliament for 30 days and suspended the immunity of all deputies. Saied claims his move is permitted in case of "imminent danger" under Article 80 of the constitution. Local media reported that military vehicles surrounded the parliament building as crowds cheered.           Tunisia has remained prone to political turmoil a decade after the 2011 revolution that ousted strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Politicians have been unable to form lasting governments. Mechichi's government was the third cabinet to come to power in less than a year.
