The government has increased civil servants' salaries by between 45% to 50% as it fulfils a promise to stagger the wage increment for employees. In April 2021 government increased civil servants' salaries by 25% and committed to further increases by mid-year. However workers have rejected the salary increment, saying it was inadequate as it will result in the lowest paid teacher earning below the poverty datum line. Instead, they demanded restoration of their 2018 salaries that were paid in U.S. dollars, when they earned between U.S.$520 and U.S.$550 per month, or its equivalent in local currency. Most primary and secondary school teachers are cashing-in on the prolonged closure of schools through conducting lucrative online classes, it has emerged. The recent spike in new Covid-19 infections, and deaths has forced the government to postpone the reopening of schools as a way of controlling the raging pandemic. Since President Emmerson Mnangagwa took office in November 2017, teachers have continually been protesting, demanding salary hikes. Meanwhile doctors and nurses have also downed tools on several occasions, demanding U.S. dollar salaries.
