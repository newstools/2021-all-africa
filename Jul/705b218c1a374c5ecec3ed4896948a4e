Scores of workers and representatives of worker organisations mobilised under the Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU)  have submitted a petition to parliament in Lilongwe, calling for the withdrawal of the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill, which, among others, restricts workers' right to industrial strikes. Jessie Ching'oma, a deputy director at MCTU, which is the umbrella body of all trade unions in Malawi, demanded that parliament withdraws the amendment bill, saying there were no consultations.  Ching'oma said: "The right to strike is part of our fundamental rights and principles as workers. This right is also enshrined in the constitution."  The bill, which proposes amendments to Labour Relations and Employment Acts, includes that the employer must be given powers to deduct wages of an employee on strike, whether it is illegal or not. It also wants the courts to categorise essential services that would not be allowed to go for a strike or lockdown.
