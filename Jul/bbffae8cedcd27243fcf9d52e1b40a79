Looting and lawbreaking that started in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province after the imprisonment of former president Jacob Zuma spilled over into Gauteng province. The Daily Maverick's Julia Evans reports that protests in Gauteng, ostensibly against Zuma's imprisonment, escalated into criminality where civilians damaged property and roads, looted businesses and rioted, affecting public transport and power services. In an address to the nation on July 11, 2021 about the extension of the country's novel coronavirus lockdown measures, President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the violence, saying that "those who are involved in acts of violence will be arrested and prosecuted". In a media statement, the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure announced that arrests had been made in relation to the violence. Zuma's imprisonment follows a Constitutional Court judgment that found him guilty of contempt of court for disobeying its earlier order that he appear before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture to answer allegations from scores of witnesses about his role in state capture.
