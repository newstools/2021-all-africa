A high court in Ethiopia has delivered verdicts on three people accused of being involved in the June 2020 death of singer Haacaaluu Hundeessaa, the Addis Standard reports. Tilahun Yami was found guilty of violating an anti-terrorisom law while Kebede Gemechu and Abdi Alemehyu were found guilty of violating various penal code provisions. The court was adjourned until July 15, 2021. Hundeessaa was a revered singer and musician, whose death on June 29, 2020 sparked riots in and around Addis Ababa, killing at least 80 people. The musician was an outspoken ethnic Oromo activist who helped lead protests that brought about a new pro-Oromo government in 2018..           Hundeessaa was gunned down in Addis Ababa a week after he appeared on Oromia Media Network, where he criticized Ethiopia's leadership and spoke out against the mass incarceration of Oromo youth.
