UK-based human rights groups have expressed grave concerns over Home Office plans to deport 150 Zimbabweans, warning that their lives would be in danger. For decades, the Zimabwe government has not accepted people being forcibly returned from the UK, meaning Zimbabweans who sought asylum in Britain were left for decades, starting families and having children.  Its position has shifted in recent years and British and Zimbabwean officials met on June 23, 2021 to broker a deal on returnees. Many of the Zimbabweans in immigration detention with tickets for the charter flight, planned for July 21, 2021 say they fled their home country as a result of having campaigned for human rights in the southern African country and against its former leader, late president Robert Mugabe. Critics argue that since President Emmerson Mnangagwa replaced Mugabe in November 2017, he had outperformed his predecessor in persecuting perceived enemies of the state. However, the Zimbabwean government officials have repeatedly denied allegations of human rights abuses, saying those arrested or being sought by the police were inciting people to revolt against Mnangagwa's government.
