A plan by the European Union (EU) not to recognise Covid-19 vaccines manufactured outside the block could set back global efforts to contain the pandemic, writes Adhere Cavince for Capital FM. The EU has issued guidelines regarding the applicability of the EU Digital Covid Certificate "Green Pass" to different Covid-19 vaccines which would facilitate free and safe movement across all EU member states and associated countries. However, Covishield, the Indian version of AstraZeneca and University of Oxford's Covid vaccine, is yet to be recognised by the European Medicines Agency, though the World Health Organisation has endorsed it for emergency use across the world. Meanwhile, the government of Kenya said in a statement that denying individuals who have been vaccinated by Covishield the chance to travel to certain countries, undermines the confidence in life saving vaccines. As of July 6, 2021, a total of 5,695,659 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed across Africa, of which 147,059 proved fatal and 4,952,100  resulted in recovery.
