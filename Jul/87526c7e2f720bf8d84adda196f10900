Commerical capital Lagos State, has been the epicenter of Nigeria's Covid-19 pandemic, with 4,382 infections since the first case was recorded in February 2020. There have been 357 known deaths. Sanwo-Olu has warned of fines or even imprisonment for those who break rules to contain the virus and said the State would step up its vaccination campaign.  The government confirmed its first Covid-19 case of the Delta variant last week, according to a statement by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control. The country has over one million people vaccinated. Nigeria has recorded at least 168,552 confirmed Covid-19 cases, 164,439 recoveries, and over 2,124 fatalities.
