Zipline, arguably the world's largest drone delivery service for medical supplies which was founded in Rwanda has raised U.S.$250 million in new equity financing, bringing the company's valuation to U.S.$2.75 billion, writes Collins Mwai for The New Times. The new financing will enable Zipline to continue advancing its integrated service, including its autonomy platform, aircraft, fulfilment systems, and operations. The funding will also fuel continued expansion into new industries and geographies, transforming systems like healthcare and commerce with instant logistics.
