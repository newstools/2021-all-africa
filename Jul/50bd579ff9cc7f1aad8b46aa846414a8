Ethiopia rejects the unwelcome meddling by the League of Arab States on the matter of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) following the League's submission of a letter to the UN Security Council and UN General Assembly to intervene in the matter, according to a letter from the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Demeke Mekonnen, sent to the United Nations Security Council. The League of Arab States has a reputation for its unfettered and unconditional support to any claim Egypt has presented on the issue of the Nile, the letter adds. The letter further states that Ethiopia is engaging in the trilateral negotiations in good faith and continuing its utmost commitment to make the AU-led process a success and calls on the two lower riparian countries of the Nile to remain faithful to the ongoing African Union-led negotiation. Ethiopian Dispaora in various states of the U.S are reportedly planning to stage a demonstration in New York City to oppose the meeting of the UN Security Council on the GERD. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is the source of an almost decade-long diplomatic standoff between Ethiopia and downstream nations Egypt and Sudan. Ethiopia says the project is essential to its development, but Egypt and Sudan fear it could restrict water access to their citizens.
