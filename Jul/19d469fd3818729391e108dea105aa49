The government has received a U.S.$53 million grant from the Global Fund as a contribution towards the U.S.$280 million required for malaria prevention and treatment efforts from 2020 to 2024, writes Nasra Bishumba for The New Times. The Global Fund is a global partnership designed to accelerate the end of HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria as epidemics in more than 100 countries. A February 2019 report shows that the Global Fund invested about US$1.4 billion in Rwanda since 2003, and was running U.S.$210 million in active grants.
