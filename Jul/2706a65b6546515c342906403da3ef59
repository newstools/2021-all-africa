Southern Africa's golden tournament, the COSAFA Cup is underway in Gqeberha (formerly Port Elizabeth), South Africa.  The tournament has so far seen the late withdrawal of Madagascar from the 2021 COSAFA Cup, forcing a change in the competition's format which will now have two groups of five teams each. Madagascar had been unable to secure their travel to Nelson Mandela Bay for the July 6-18 2021 tournament which, following the decision of Comoros Islands not to participate, left the original Group B with only Zambia and Malawi, a COSAFA press release has said.  So far, host South Africa has beaten Botswana 1-0 and will go on to meet the eSwatini side. Namibia suprised by thumping Senegal 2-1 and Lesotho in an equally suprising win over Zambia. Zimbabwe and Mozambique never managed to light up the scoreboard with a 0-0 result in their match.This tournament is proving quite unpredicable this time round. See the COSAFA Cup scoreboard here.
