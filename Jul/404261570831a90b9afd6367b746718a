After six years in detention, the Kaduna State High Court has discharged and acquitted the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, Ibrahim Zakzaky, and his wife, Zeenat. The couple were released after the court dismissed the charges brought by the Kaduna state government. The charges against them included murder, culpable homicide, unlawful assembly, and the disruption of public peace.  The pair have been in detention since December 2015. A court in 2016 ordered that they be released but authorities refused. Their continued detention, however, sparked protests that turned deadly, leading the government to outlaw the group in 2019.
