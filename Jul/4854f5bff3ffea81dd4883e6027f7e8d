Only 1.5% of close to U.S.$281 million that is allocated to social assistance for the vulnerable population reaches intended targets in Uganda, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). At least 22% of Ugandans, which translates to more than 8.3 million people are classified as vulnerable but more than 76% or more than 6.3 million never access social assistance. The IMF has noted that there is need for government to strengthen social assistance programmes and improve targeted assistance through a broad-based approach that is infused in tax policy measures with focus put on mobilising more money in taxes to expand social assistance. Government extends social assistance to vulnerable Ugandans through a number of programmes including Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment (SAGE), Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme, Expanding Social Protection, Community Rehabilitation Programme for the Disabled and Youth Livelihood Programme, among others. However, implementation of such programmes is hindered by lack of empirical data on targeted individuals, which makes it almost impossible for government to sufficiently extend social assistance.
