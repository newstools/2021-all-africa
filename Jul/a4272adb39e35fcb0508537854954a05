Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has vowed to repel fresh offensives by Tigrayan forces as they recapture major cities in Southern Tigray and made advances toward Amhara region. This as commercial activity in the Tigray region is hampered by the ongoing crisis that began with fighting nine months ago. Over the last two weeks, since commercial traffic ground to a halt, food prices are skyrocketing. Banks throughout the region are now closed, and people are running out of cash to cover basic needs, says the International Red Cross. While UN agencies say that funding needs to accomodate Ethiopian refugees in Sudan have increased by $33 million bringing the total assistance to about $182 million for the expected 120,000 refugee arrivals until the end of the year. The Addis Standard - an independent publication - tweeted a statement saying that it had stopped operations after the Ethiopia Media Authority, the country's statutory regulator, had withdrawn the license of the outlet's publisher. The regulator did not provide any reason for the decision, that statement said. And Amnesty International has called for the release of detainees, after police in Addis Ababa arbitrarily arrested and detained Tigrayans, activists and journalists without due process, following the recapture of the Tigray region's capital, Mekelle.
