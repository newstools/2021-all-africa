The government's efforts to reintegrate former Boko Haram militants have seen hundreds go through rehabilitation. The UN Women International Organisation for Migration, as well as the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, have called for the inclusion of women in the reintegration, reconciliation, and rehabilitation process in the northeast. They have stressed the need for women's participation in the states ravaged by the Boko Haram insurgency, to achieve better results.  The organisers noted that projects on disengagement, disassociation, reintegration, and reconciliation are already underway in the northeast region despite the challenges of ongoing hostilities. But they decried that these peace-making processes are often led and dominated by men, hence the need for a dialogue on inclusion. Thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced since the start of the Boko Haram insurgency in 2009.
