The Kenyan government has abandoned its demand that it should be the sole distributor of a U.S.$19 million consignment of HIV drugs donated by the U.S., ending a six-month standoff on distribution of the anti-retroviral drugs. However, the two governments have reached a compromise that the consignment stuck at the Port of Mombasa will be distributed by Mission for Essential Drugs and Supplies (MEDS). The government had insisted that only the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency would distribute the drugs to counties. The ARVs, among other medicines imported in January 2021, have been lying at the Port of Mombasa for six months. They were donated by the U.S. government through its aid agency USAid, and are yet to be taken to county hospitals, writes Angela Oketch for The Nation.
